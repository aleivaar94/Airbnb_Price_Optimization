      "      \"Geoff place was a great little stay. Downtown in Calgary near plenty of good restaurants it was easy to get around everywhere! Loved the little map at the front door to give local spots to stop by! Would happily stay there again in the future\",\n",
      "      \"Geoff’s spot was a great place for my wife to stay at an affordable rate. It had a washer and dryer which was helpful and a kitchenette with an air fryer and fridge. The on-site parking was super helpful since parking can get expensive quickly. Overall, pretty good experience\",\n",
      "      \"The perfect little place to bunker down after a long day of exploring.<br/>Everything was clean and tidy and the bed was super comfy!!<br/>There was a bit of noise from upstairs frequently but I guess that makes sense as it is the bottom floor!<br/>Very much enjoyed my stay here.\",\n",
      "      \"We really enjoyed our stay here! Great location, super walkable, and convenient to all of our favorite places. Having the option for off-street parking was a huge plus for us. It’s a great space and we would definitely stay here again!\",\n",
      "      \"Geoff's Airbnb was right in the heart of the city. We were able to leave the car parked up and walk everywhere in the city. The suite was clean and well furnished, with a lovely kitchen with all the amenities you need on a vacation. It was nice and private and clean. Geoff was a great host and always responded. He even gave us a contact number for emergencies at night, so very thoughtful. You may want to bring your earplugs if you want to sleep in. It was quiet at night, but we could hear the people above in the morning.\",\n",
      "      \"Probably the best location to stay in Calgary!!! Within walking distance of downtown (lrt) and 17th .  We parked our vehicle and didn’t have to touch it all weekend.  Just remember it’s a basement suite so don’t expect fabulous views\",\n",
      "      \"What a great find in the heart of downtown Calgary! Easily walkable to anything and everything in the downtown area. Great communication with the hosts who made sure I had everything I needed. Definitely recommend for a solo traveler or couple who wants to be close to all that downtown has to offer.\",\n",
      "      \"A great experience overall. The suite was clean, comfortable, and had everything I needed. The location is super convenient, which made getting around really easy. Geoff and Taylor were incredibly responsive and helpful — communication was seamless throughout. I’d happily stay here again!\",\n",
      "      \"Geoff’s place was clean and matched the description perfectly. Communication was easy and they were very responsive and accommodating to requests.

We had a concern with the bedding but they promptly changed it after we noticed a brown stain on the mattress pad and mattress, and they kindly offered to tackle other cleanliness issues we pointed out. However, we were disappointed with the overall cleanliness of the space upon arrival. There was noticeable buildup on the backsplash, dust caked in the bathroom fan aswell as on baseboards. While the hosts’ efforts to resolve these were appreciated, the initial condition of the property fell short of our expectations for a comfortable stay. If we weren’t pressed for time and alternative accommodations, we likely would not have stayed. We hope these issues can be addressed for future guests, as the hosts’ attentiveness shows their commitment to improving the experience.\",\n",

      "      \"The location of Geoff and Taylor's place was incredible and the fact that they offered parking was even more amazing!  The only downside is the lack of natural lighting and fresh air.  The blinds were closed for privacy (totally understandable),  but it would have been nice to be able to open up the window.  Luckily there was a really good fan, so it made for a comfortable night's sleep.  <br/>They were so great with communicating and checking in with me.  I let them know that the sink was draining slowly and that one of the plugs didn't seem to be working, assuring me they would look into it asap.  Any time I had a question they got back to me pretty much right away.<br/>Overall the good definitely outweighed the back and I can't wait to be back!\",\n",

      "      \"Great spot to stay close to the downtown area, bonus that it has a parking garage available. I wouldn't want to drive anything more than a large SUV though as getting in and out of the parking garage would be tricky...like a 10-point turn if you were driving a large truck lol. A little bit of noise from upstairs but I suppose you expect that in a townhome like this. But otherwise this was a nice no frills stay. Oh and a super comfy mattress!\",\n",

We had a concern with the bedding but they promptly changed it after we noticed a brown stain on the mattress pad and mattress, and they kindly offered to tackle other cleanliness issues we pointed out. However, we were disappointed with the overall cleanliness of the space upon arrival. There was noticeable buildup on the backsplash, dust caked in the bathroom fan aswell as on baseboards. While the hosts’ efforts to resolve these were appreciated, the initial condition of the property fell short of our expectations for a comfortable stay. If we weren’t pressed for time and alternative accommodations, we likely would not have stayed. We hope these issues can be addressed for future guests, as the hosts’ attentiveness shows their commitment to improving the experience.\",\n",

However, your review overstates the issues.<br/>The home was professionally cleaned before check-in, and there is no cleaning fee to stay at our place - likely a large factor in your decision to book here. You noted a minor stain, which we immediately addressed, and we offered to reclean any areas of concern. Every request was handled promptly and respectfully.<br/>Citing dust on a bathroom ceiling fan—an out-of-reach fixture not typically inspected daily—as a sign of poor cleanliness is simply unreasonable. We welcome fair, constructive feedback, but we also stand by the quality and service that so many guests consistently recognize.<br/>We encourage future guests to approach stays with reasonable expectations and to review our many positive ratings for a more accurate picture of the experience.\"\n",

We were told about the door cam watching for “extra guests” but there’s also sound detector inside the apartment and it felt like we were being watched. When we unplugged the modem to plug it directly into our laptop we were immediately messaged to plug it back in and it made us feel extremely uncomfortable.\",\n",

The room was very comfortable and clean, with all the necessary amenities. A particular highlight was the stunning city view from the property. It was breathtaking both during the day and at night. Highly recommended!\",\n",
      "      \"Richard & Teresa’s Airbnb was absolutely perfect for our trip. It is located in a prime location with many restaurants, coffee shops, bakeries and a food hall right across the street. We enjoyed being able to walk across the street and enjoy a meal or pickup a coffee. This unit has the most amazing view of the Calgary skyline that lit up at night. The unit was cozy, clean and set up very intentionally to ensure that guests have everything they need. They included multiple amenities from the in unit laundry to the complimentary snacks and drinks. We were very pleased with the space as well as the underground parking. We would definitely recommend this place to others and would definitely stay again :)\",\n",

We were welcomed with complimentary snacks which were very handy. It was nice to have coffee and creamer at the airbnb. There were also a few other things I noticed that would be handy if a person stayed longer; spices, cooking oil and vinaigrettes. The beds and pillows were so comfortable. We just all in all had a great stay. The view and the lights at night are absolutely beautiful!\",\n",

Overall, 10/10 and will definitely be booking again\",\n",

Richard and Teresa were extremely kind hosts, and very generous with our Christmas Day checkout. <br/>The unit itself is exactly like the photos and as described. The views are absolutely amazing, and it is both relaxing and awe-inspiring to just sit and look at the city lights in the evening. The decor is top notch, and well thought out. Homey touches such as curated DVDs, games, and books make this a true city retreat. <br/>Having underground parking and an elevator made it accessible to people with more limited mobility, and was super important to us. <br/>This was the perfect location for our last minute visit, and we felt so kindly accommodated by Richard and Teresa.

I also walked into the city regularly, to work at coffee shops. The walk is only ~15-20 minutes, which is also pleasant to get fresh air and see the city. The local area of Mission is also enjoyable if you want some food or a smaller coffee shop.<br/>The building and property are also beautiful, but the apartment I stayed in (202) is on the non-river side. I think the listing photo is a little misleading, as it showcases the river photo first, but this is not your experience in this apartment. Your keys get you access to this back area with the river, but only the grass and some used dirty lawn furniture. If you are renting this apartment for that beautiful view and outdoor experience, you are not going to get it.<br/>Still worth the stay, if you want a beautiful apartment and a well-organised AirBnB experience!\",\n",

The place is clean, great furniture, nice rooms, great kitchen, and an excellent place to sit and work with a nice desk setup.  I also walked into the city regularly, to work at coffee shops. The walk is only ~15-20 minutes, which is also pleasant to get fresh air and see the city. The local area of Mission is also enjoyable if you want some food or a smaller coffee shop.<br/>The building and property are also beautiful, but the apartment I stayed in (202) is on the non-river side. I think the listing photo is a little misleading, as it showcases the river photo first, but this is not your experience in this apartment. Your keys get you access to this back area with the river, but only the grass and some used dirty lawn furniture. If you are renting this apartment for that beautiful view and outdoor experience, you are not going to get it.<br/>Still worth the stay, if you want a beautiful apartment and a well-organised AirBnB experience!\",\n",

      "      \"Had a great stay at Clint and Diana’s place for a girls weekend. It was the perfect size for four girls and very close to many bars in the city. Having a parking spot for this area of the city is also a great benefit. Clint and Diana were also very responsive as hosts. Would definitely recommend/stay here again.\",\n",
      "      \"So, Clint and Diana were very nice and super responsive, the place was clean and nothing was broken. <br/>However, there wasn’t enough toilet paper or paper towels, No BBQ utensils, and only one key to get in and out of the building.<br/>Lastly the pool was completely misleading. <br/>Super small, and didn’t get really any sun.\",\n",
      "      \"Very clear videos on how check In and anything you may need help with during your stay. The apartment was beautiful and very comfortable. Quality furniture and linens. The building itself felt secure and safe. The pool was great for the kids to swim. Overall very happy with our stay, only downside was that the parking space is VERY tight for any larger vehicles .. we have a Toyota sienna van and ended up paying for parking at the Impark parking lot just across the street (no biggie it was very close) but just a heads up to anyone with a larger vehicle it might not fit.\",\n",
      "      \"Perfect stay complete with stunning views, ultra luxurious decor, quiet and secure building, access to a heated pool and fitness room, full kitchen and laundry, and walkable to all downtown attractions and activities! From the moment we booked, Clint and Diana were warm and welcoming, quick to respond, flexible, and ensured we had everything we need. We can’t wait to come back and stay here again! ❤️\",\n",
      "      \"If all AirBnBs were this clean, cozy and easy to navigate as a rental there would be no place for hotels ever again. Great hosts, that were quick to respond and offered suggestions regarding local amenities, as I wasn’t familiar with the city. Beautiful space! Bedding is a huge deal for me and everything was top notch quality and comfort. I couldn’t be happier.\",\n",
      "      \"Clint and Diana’s place is perfect for a stay in downtown Calgary. They are both really great to work with, they made check in seamless and had some really helpful videos to walk you through the process. Their apartment is gorgeous and well appointed with everything one would need for an evening dining in. I highly recommend their place for a stay In Calgary\",\n",
      "      \"Clint and Diana were very helpful, the check-in instructions even involved videos which I appreciated. The condo is bright and cheerful with beautiful views of Calgary and the mountains in the distance. We didn’t have any trouble getting to where we needed to go, it’s really central. <br/>The kitchen is well equipped, the couch is per for looking out at the city with a beverage and the balcony is a really nice place to relax. The beds are comfortable, the sheets are soft and the pillows were not too hard or too soft. <br/>All around a very enjoyable visit.\",\n",
      "      \"This downtown location is hard to beat and being on the 17th floor you get views of the mountains in the distance from the balcony. it was so nice to have a balcony with a bbq to use in the evening for cooking super as well as the two chairs provided on the balcony as well.\",\n",

Communication was great and all the instructions were very clear. Good location and plenty of eating places nearby plus a good size supermarket Parking space included and was a good size. If you need parking for a large truck there areseveral parking lots nearby. We would have no hesitation at staying again.\",\n",

Clint was very responsive and accommodating!  Didn’t have chance to try pool but it looked good.  Would definitely stay again.\",\n",

      "      \"When we arrived at this Airbnb it smelled strongly of cigarette smoke. I contacted the hosts and while they said they could not smell any cigarette smoke, they were very responsive bringing us an air purifier. While I did appreciate they tried to remedy the situation and left some chocolates the place still smelled smokey for our stay.<br/>The apartment was clean, had great views, coffee and a well stocked kitchen  but it was very tight for three women. The sofa bed was very hard, and there were no sheets for it. There were some pillows in the closet but there were no pillowcases. So instead of each of us being able to have her own sleeping space we had to double up and share a bed which was not preferable. <br/>The listing stated there is body soap and a bidet but there was not. I think this place has potential but it needs to be accurately listed and guests should set their expectations for a small place that would be good for two adults and maybe some small children.\",\n",

I contacted the hosts and while they said they could not smell any cigarette smoke, they were very responsive bringing us an air purifier. While I did appreciate they tried to remedy the situation and left some chocolates the place still smelled smokey for our stay.<br/>The apartment was clean, had great views, coffee and a well stocked kitchen  but it was very tight for three women. The sofa bed was very hard, and there were no sheets for it. There were some pillows in the closet but there were no pillowcases. So instead of each of us being able to have her own sleeping space we had to double up and share a bed which was not preferable. <br/>The listing stated there is body soap and a bidet but there was not. I think this place has potential but it needs to be accurately listed and guests should set their expectations for a small place that would be good for two adults and maybe some small children.\",\n",

While we didn’t notice any cigarette smoke ourselves - even after checkout - we trust your experience and hope the purifier helped ensure clean air for your stay. Bedding (duvet, sheets, & pillow with pillowcase) for the sofa bed can be found inside the sofa storage itself. Since bedding is such an important detail we’ll be sure to highlight this for future guests; however, we wish you had reached out - just as you did about the smoke - as it would have been a quick and simple fix to let you know where to find it. The square footage & floor plan are included in our listing so guests can ensure the space fits their needs, and we’ve corrected an oversight in the amenities list (bidet) to keep everything accurate moving forward.

It was really quiet and peaceful inside and when you'd walk out to the main street, you were part of all the action and in a great area buzzing with people, music, restaurants, and a great vibe. We recommend this Airbnb and would love to stay here again on our next visit!\",\n",

Apartment itself is a mix of Art Nouveau art gallery and highly functional apartment. Nice laundry room in the basement of building with high quality washer and dryer. Bryn is extremely attentive host and was instantly communicated to lend us a helpful hand. Location could not be any better. Right on 17th Ave but set a little back so it’s very tranquil. On one side we had shops and restaurants in walking distance and on the other side we had upscale neighborhood with walking paths to have an evening stroll. I couldn’t make any better choice for my stay in Calgary. Definitely will stay again.\",\n",

Situated just off 17th street it gave us access to breakfast at our doorstep, lunch one block away, and late night snack spots and bars scoutable from our window.<br/>Being just at the edge of downtown meant we were walking distance from all the best Museums, attractions and events (like Stampeded, Yeehaw!). But when we were done for the night, the suite felt tucked away just far enough from the bustle, so we could relax and enjoy the beautiful decor, creative amenities, and the star of the suite the king sized bed!!<br/>All in all, this was a 11/10 experience. The location was perfect, the suite was idyllic and the our host was friendly and helpful. Absolutely my best experience in an Airbnb. Can't wait to visit again!\",\n",

However, the easy check in, amazing decor, cleanliness and welcoming setting will keep us coming back. A stone's throw to the many pubs, restaurants shops and amenities is amazing, however being half a block off the main strip allowed for a restful sleep. Parking included is also a plus as it is paid or permit parking only in the area. This is a great place to book with great ambience and convenient location. Will highly recommend to anyone traveling to Calgary.\",\n",

And it was great to be able to walk to charming restaurants along 17th Ave  for breakfast and dinner.  I felt like I had truly gotten away for the weekend to someplace in Europe.   And the king size bed was so comfortable!  I often have a sore back when I sleep away from home but my back felt great and I had a terrific sleep both nights.\",\n",

Having a coffee shop and Shoppers Drug Mart right outside was super convenient for quick groceries and  coffee in the AM.<br/>The space itself was cozy and comfortable, especially in the living room  looking out the window—beautiful brick architecture, blue skies, and Calgary’s downtown skyline in the background. Also it was very cold outside so we stayed in most nights and tried out the home movie theater experience, it was very neat.  I’d like to return in the summer to take full advantage of the walkability and everything 17th Ave has to offer. Highly recommend!\",\n",

Bryn is extremely attentive host and was instantly communicated to lend us a helpful hand. Location could not be any better. Right on 17th Ave but set a little back so it’s very tranquil. On one side we had shops and restaurants in walking distance and on the other side we had upscale neighborhood with walking paths to have an evening stroll. I couldn’t make any better choice for my stay in Calgary. Definitely will stay again.\",\n",

Situated just off 17th street it gave us access to breakfast at our doorstep, lunch one block away, and late night snack spots and bars scoutable from our window.<br/>Being just at the edge of downtown meant we were walking distance from all the best Museums, attractions and events (like Stampeded, Yeehaw!). But when we were done for the night, the suite felt tucked away just far enough from the bustle, so we could relax and enjoy the beautiful decor, creative amenities, and the star of the suite the king sized bed!!<br/>All in all, this was a 11/10 experience.

A stone's throw to the many pubs, restaurants shops and amenities is amazing, however being half a block off the main strip allowed for a restful sleep.

Having a coffee shop and Shoppers Drug Mart right outside was super convenient for quick groceries and  coffee in the AM.<br/>The space itself was cozy and comfortable, especially in the living room  looking out the window—beautiful brick architecture, blue skies, and Calgary’s downtown skyline in the background. Also it was very cold outside so we stayed in most nights and tried out the home movie theater experience, it was very neat.

      "      \"Easy and seamless stay, JD was very proactive with reaching out and asking if I needed anything. Responded immediately. Place was in a great location and the apartment was clean and tidy with everything I needed. Thank you for your stay.\",\n",
      "      \"We had a great time at JD Lee’s place! He made it possible for us to stay there on very short notice, and the communication couldn’t have been better. The location is central and close to several bars and restaurants. We’d definitely recommend it!\",\n",
      "      \"Interior was clean and well stocked. Way too hot in the unit even though it was cool outside the entire time so I left sliding door open at night which allowed smells and noise.  Air conditioner did not cool off the unit even when running all night, whether or not door was left open. Sliding door did not have a lock anyway. I asked how to cool off the unit, with cryptic response. I gave up and left after 4 days of sweat. Too smelly and hot. Also scary building for a single woman. Above liquor store, homeless people, marijuana,\",\n",
      "      \"Great location, and very good communication. JD reacted quickly and tried his best to solve any problem as fast as possible. Unfortunately, we cannot give 5 stars as there were too many things that would have needed long-term maintenance beforehand. We were constantly confronted with new problems . The first night, we could not find any bedding, and there was only 1 towel.  They were all well hidden in the couch, but we could not find where and how to open it. The main light in the living room was broken. The mosquito net had a huge hole.  The bathroom sink was clogged up, and JD had to come twice to resolve the problem. The shower hose was full of holes; JD bought a new one and put it in the same day. Last not least, the oven did not heat up beyond 270 F which jeopardized our cooking plans.<br/>As JD was very responsive, we trust that he resolves all the issues soon. If we had not been busy for 3 days with repair requests, we might have given 5 stars; maybe next time.\",\n",
      "      \"The unit was well kept, clean and had a minimalist feel to it. The location is excellent because it close to many restaurants and shopping. It is a busy street with many bars and pubs in the area but the unit is in the back of the building and there is no excessive noise. Overall a great stay! Thanks JD!\",\n",
      "      \"This location was perfect. Within walking distance to many great restaurants/bars, shopping and arenas. JD was an excellent host. He was extremely responsive to any issue we had and provided excellent recommendations for things to do in the area. The only thing we didn’t love was the bed was a little uncomfortable. Otherwise, highly recommend this spot.\",\n",
      "      \"Spot was very nice and quiet. Walking distance to lots of fun places.\",\n",
      "      \"I booked JD's place for my parents during Stampede. This upped the price, but compared to similar properties JD's was more fairly priced. JD was a great host and very communicative. His instructions were clear and in depth and check in went very smoothly. JD even communicated that the apartment may be noisier than usual being on 17th during Stampede. However, my parents reported that noise from the street was not an issue as they were facing the back. JD was also readily available via message during the stay should we need him. <br/>The apartment was spotless when we arrived and had all amenities needed for a comfortable stay. It was well presented and had plenty of space for two. My parents reported that the bed was comfy and easy to sleep in. Their only complaint was that the air conditioning unit was too loud to use at night (another thing JD did pre-warn us about). <br/>The apartment is in a great location being on 17th and I would definitely recommend it! Thank you JD\",\n",
      "      \"During our stay, JD was very accommodating in addressing each issue that we had, despite the occasional slow responses. The area was perfect—with the restaurants, shops, and grocery stores within walking distance. The Airbnb itself was great, and it provided a lot of essential items (including lint rollers which we appreciated). I wouldn’t really recommend staying here if you’re sensitive to the heat, which I was. The lack of ventilation should be of note, as open windows were required the entire time we were there just to keep the temperature tolerable. Though, leaving the windows open also meant being able to hear all the commotion outside the building since it’s a pretty busy street, especially at night. Aside from those things, the place was nice, clean, and simple.\",\n",

Unfortunately, we cannot give 5 stars as there were too many things that would have needed long-term maintenance beforehand. We were constantly confronted with new problems . The first night, we could not find any bedding, and there was only 1 towel.  They were all well hidden in the couch, but we could not find where and how to open it. The main light in the living room was broken. The mosquito net had a huge hole.  The bathroom sink was clogged up, and JD had to come twice to resolve the problem. The shower hose was full of holes; JD bought a new one and put it in the same day. Last not least, the oven did not heat up beyond 270 F which jeopardized our cooking plans.<br/>As JD was very responsive, we trust that he resolves all the issues soon. If we had not been busy for 3 days with repair requests, we might have given 5 stars; maybe next time.\",\n",

Please refrain yourself from saying “there was no bedding” when the main bed was completely ready. That’s not true. <br/>You were asking for extra beddings/towels; which were provided immediately. <br/>I advised you to take a look underneath the pull out couch in the living room, and you were not able to find em yourself.

JD was also readily available via message during the stay should we need him. <br/>The apartment was spotless when we arrived and had all amenities needed for a comfortable stay. It was well presented and had plenty of space for two. My parents reported that the bed was comfy and easy to sleep in.

He was warm, respectful, and went out of his way to make us feel comfortable, yet he was also very private—spending time in his room or at work—so we never felt crowded and had all the space we needed.<br/>Tareq’s communication was excellent; he offered thoughtful local recommendations and was always prompt and helpful in his responses. He’s a wonderful person, and we felt completely at ease during our stay. We also really appreciated being able to use his washer and dryer before continuing our travels—such a helpful and generous perk!<br/>The location is fantastic—within walking distance of restaurants, cafes, and the Stampede grounds, making it ideal for the event. <br/>Thank you, Tareq, for your hospitality and kindness!\",\n",

Her place offered stunning views of the Calgary Tower especially at night when the whole city is lit up! The place was very clean and comes with complete amenities that made our stay feel like at home. Definitely staying here again in the future!\",\n",

The host insisted I wait till 4pm before checking in and I had to go lodge in a hotel till next day. Secondly, the host would have informed me to use the buzzer to come in first day (this could be improved). Location is fantastic, near downtown with easy access to everything. I don’t know if I’d stay again.\",\n",

No issues with check in, all very easy…. The view is fantastic, you get the sunrise which is nice. It’s a cute small apartment, the washing machine and dryer were great as well.

I would highly recommend booking here if you want great views, very clean Airbnb, and lots to do within walking distance. The bed was very comfortable & the shower was nice and hot! Kitchen has everything you need!<br/>Noble Pie is the best pizza we ever ate and you can see the restaurant from the window! We were near 17 Ave where there are a ton of restaurants/bars. We went to the Prohibition Lounge for their Jazz Thursday. Also recommend the Comery Block for great BBQ/drinks!  Hudson's Canada Pub, Bottlescrew Bill's Pub, and Last Best Brewing were also nearby and great for a bite to eat and a drink. We loved everything we tried while in Downtown Calgary.

All the instructions for the stay were in a convenient portal online. The building was easy to find and in a very walkable downtown. Beth was responsive and very helpful. I would highly recommend booking here if you want great views, very clean Airbnb, and lots to do within walking distance. The bed was very comfortable & the shower was nice and hot! Kitchen has everything you need!<br/>Noble Pie is the best pizza we ever ate and you can see the restaurant from the window! We were near 17 Ave where there are a ton of restaurants/bars. We went to the Prohibition Lounge for their Jazz Thursday. Also recommend the Comery Block for great BBQ/drinks!  Hudson's Canada Pub, Bottlescrew Bill's Pub, and Last Best Brewing were also nearby and great for a bite to eat and a drink. We loved everything we tried while in Downtown Calgary. We can't wait to come back and book another stay!\",\n",

Unfortunately again he did not read the instructions even after that which led to the guest being confused, we continued to assist happily. <br/>Clarification, there is no fee if you arrive between 4pm to 10pm. Another example of the guests confusion. <br/>Once the guest arrived he was upset because he said he needed two bedrooms, which we do not advertise. <br/>We do our best to help guests and in this case it was outside of our control. <br/>Our over 6,000 reviews showcase our consistent positive guest experiences :)\"\n",

      "      \"⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ Amazing Stay with a Stunning Downtown View!<br/>I absolutely loved my stay at this Airbnb! The highlight was definitely the breathtaking downtown Calgary view — it was beautiful both day and night. The apartment was spotless, modern, and had everything I needed for a comfortable stay. The host was friendly, responsive, and made check-in super easy. The location couldn’t be better — right in the heart of the city\",\n",
      "      \"This place was such a lucky find! It was so beautiful! Karly had lots of nice little touches that made the place feel luxurious and comfortable. She was very responsive and checked in on us throughout our stay. The view alone was worth the money, beautiful views of the sunset from up on the 17th floor! Loved our stay and hope to be back in the future.\",\n",
      "      \"What a view!   Beautiful condo with amazing views.  Comfortable king bed and fully stocked kitchen.  Was great to have the underground parking stall.  Thanks for a wonderful stay.\",\n",
      "      \"I booked a different unit for an employee who was visiting town, when I found out a couple of hours before check in that the unit was no longer available. In a pinch, I booked this unit. Karly was absolutely wonderful! She was super helpful and responded to my messages promptly. She was also able to accommodate an early check in as our employee had already arrived to town and the unit was available. The unit itself was absolutely beautiful, and very clean. The pictures portray it perfectly! Our employee was very happy with this place. Highly recommended and look forward to booking here again!! Thanks Karly and Kelly!\",\n",

      "      \"We had such a wonderful stay! Karly was incredibly accommodating and communicative from start to finish, which made everything so easy. The little extras she provided were such a thoughtful touch - from the bath salts to the black makeup-removal towel (so much better than white facecloths!) to the cozy Fairmont robes. The kitchen was stocked with everything we could possibly need, and the included parking was the clincher for us.<br/>Although we were only in town for one night, we truly wished we could have stayed longer. The location is unbeatable - having lived in Calgary for three years, I can say this is the best area for restaurants, coffee shops, brewpubs, and easy access to downtown and the convention centre.<br/>We’d absolutely stay again and recommend Karly’s place to anyone visiting Calgary!\",\n",

The front desk had to tell us how their “guest parking” works. However getting in contact with host was easy and he responded/clarified the parking situation immediately. Overall place was nice and clean!\",\n",
      "      \"even though the train tracks are there you never really heard them and the people on the streets were polite and minded there own business as long as you mind your own. the quick response times for questions the answers came quick and we're very detailed unfortunately we went when the pool was shut down because winter is coming but definitely love to check the place out again come summer check out the pool and yeah other than that everything was relaxing calm quiet unless you had the balcony door open and you heard the train\",\n",
      "      \"This place was ideal for a two-week stay, featuring a small kitchen and a small pool for lounging. The check-in was not accessible as it requires hearing the intercom. Overall, it was very clean, in the right locations, and all amenities were provided for the stay.\",\n",

      "      \"My wife and I stayed here during stampede week.  The condo itself was nice and was in a good location downtown to get to bars and restaurants as well as public transportation.  There are a lot of homeless in the immediate area due to bottle recycling next door, but similar to other areas downtown.  Noise was a problem the entire time we stayed, condo backs up to Badlands concert venue which has techno music playing from 6pm to 2am for the 10 days of stampede week.  The music and bass made it impossible to sleep or watch tv at night.  The venue also does random sound checks in the morning and through the day.  WiFi in the condo didn’t work well the entire time, could barely have one thing working at a time, if streaming tv, personal devices didn’t work well and vice verse.  Contacted host after second day but no improvement.  Seems like most people in the building were short term and there for stampede week as well and not actual residents.  If not for noise and wifi would’ve been great\",\n",

The condo itself was nice and was in a good location downtown to get to bars and restaurants as well as public transportation.  There are a lot of homeless in the immediate area due to bottle recycling next door, but similar to other areas downtown.  Noise was a problem the entire time we stayed, condo backs up to Badlands concert venue which has techno music playing from 6pm to 2am for the 10 days of stampede week.  The music and bass made it impossible to sleep or watch tv at night.  The venue also does random sound checks in the morning and through the day.  WiFi in the condo didn’t work well the entire time, could barely have one thing working at a time, if streaming tv, personal devices didn’t work well and vice verse.  Contacted host after second day but no improvement.  Seems like most people in the building were short term and there for stampede week as well and not actual residents.

The neighbourhood was ideal: easy to get coffee in the morning, very walkable.<br/>One thing to note is that one of the bedrooms is windowless while the other bedroom is separated from the shared area by translucent sliding doors. There was no problem with privacy, but light from the shared area does diffuse through to that bedroom. So if there's anyone in the group likely to stay up late in the shared area, they should probably take that bedroom.

It was perfect for ease of walking to work, trying out local restaurants, and the overall value was good.<br/>Reasons why I didn't give 5 stars: <br/>1) There was no coffee, which I was I was expecting based on the listing. That was a bit of a bummer since I got in late.<br/>2) The unit is plain, which is great if you're primary goal is to be out and about... but I think a bit more decoration could help elevate the vibe for time spent in the unit.\",\n",

The neighbourhood was ideal: easy to get coffee in the morning, very walkable.<br/>One thing to note is that one of the bedrooms is windowless while the other bedroom is separated from the shared area by translucent sliding doors. There was no problem with privacy, but light from the shared area does diffuse through to that bedroom. So if there's anyone in the group likely to stay up late in the shared area, they should probably take that bedroom. My friend and I were both on a similar schedule so it wasn't a problem for us.<br/>Overall it was a comfortable and convenient place to stay, at a vary fair price.

The file cabinet's one drawer is a little bit out of shape when we retrieved sheets for Sofa Bed. <br/>Although no parking provided by the condo, but easy to find paid street parking around and the Impark lot  82 is just cross the street.

It had all the essentials, from a fully equipped kitchen to cozy living space details that made it feel like home.<br/>The view from the balcony was fantastic, with a clear sightline to Calgary Tower and the city skyline, perfect for relaxing mornings or evenings. The space was private, quiet, and very comfortable, making it an ideal place to unwind after a day out.<br/>David was an excellent host — extremely responsive, friendly, and made sure everything was taken care of. The Check-in process was super smooth. The location was also incredibly convenient for exploring downtown Calgary.<br/>Overall, a perfect blend of comfort, style, and hospitality.

Always a treat getting to spend time with her, and staying at Chloe and Jason’s for the bill perfectly. <br/>There’s a lot going on in the neighborhood. Good restaurants and bars, real businesses, and other residential projects. I was able to walk to my morning meetings downtown in no time. 17th Street is also just a quick walk with more bars and restaurants and even a pharmacy. <br/>The suite is generous and beautiful. It’s very well designed and the two balconies face South and East. This isn’t your typical condo project - you don’t have to leave your room to change your mind :)<br/>Chloe and Jason made sure everything was taken care of and responded inside of 10 minutes and sometimes immediately. It was very reliable communication.  <br/>Plenty of pillows and comfortable bedding to melt into after marathon days.\",\n",
      "      \"I wanted to share my stay in this apartment. The apartment was fabulous. The booking went smooth. I give them 5/5 but I faced a scary experience with the building itself. They have two garages in the underground parking. The main one and there's another trap metal door the further you drive down. If you drive an SUV it will give a small height space. I drove through this trap door following another car infront of me with a reasonable allowance. I followed since I was close to the car and the door was fully open when I looked. As I was in the middle I heard a sound that was the metal door hitting the top of my Audi q7 shattering the top of my windshield. Thankfully I was not injured but my hope through this message is that people will be careful with the garage when they stay at this location.<br/>Thanks,<br/>Moira\",\n",

The check-in process was very clear and smooth, and overall, we’re really happy with our experience.<br/>One suggestion for the host: the checkout instructions ask guests to pile up used towels, linens, and rags in the bedroom. While it’s understandable to help the cleaning staff identify used items, I’d personally prefer if the host’s team handled that entirely to avoid any hygiene issues—especially since guests might accidentally forget something.<br/>Also worth mentioning (as other reviews have noted), there are some homeless people around the neighborhood, but this didn’t affect our stay and is, of course, outside the host’s control.<br/>Overall, we’d definitely recommend this place and would stay again!\",\n",
      "      \"We were honestly quite disappointed with our 2-night stay, mainly because of two things. First, when we arrived, the master bedroom wasn’t clean at all. the floor was still dirty, like it hadn’t even been swept. The towels also smelled bad and we had to wash them before using them. The sofa in the living room also had an unpleasant smell which made it uncomfortable to sit on.<br/>Second, the TV wasn’t working the whole time we were there. We were told it was already having issues and still being fixed but we feel like it should have been sorted out before our check-in. We were told multiple times that someone would come by to fix it, so we waited the whole day but no one showed up. That was really frustrating.<br/>We paid the full price expecting a relaxing stay, but instead, it ended up being stressful. Please make sure the place is fully cleaned and ready before guests arrive. The thing is, the unit itself is actually nice and the view is beautiful. It just needs be maintained well.\",\n",

Once inside, the space far exceeded my expectations, with stunning views and thoughtful touches throughout.<br/>It's worth noting that some of the surrounding area faces social challenges, which are beyond the hosts’ control, just something to be aware of. That said, the secure parking and overall convenience of the location more than made up for it. <br/>I genuinely appreciated the care and effort the hosts put into making this a great stay.<br/>Thanks again, and hats off to the hosts for doing such a great job.

Good restaurants and bars, real businesses, and other residential projects. I was able to walk to my morning meetings downtown in no time. 17th Street is also just a quick walk with more bars and restaurants and even a pharmacy. <br/>The suite is generous and beautiful. It’s very well designed and the two balconies face South and East. This isn’t your typical condo project - you don’t have to leave your room to change your mind :)<br/>Chloe and Jason made sure everything was taken care of and responded inside of 10 minutes and sometimes immediately. It was very reliable communication.  <br/>Plenty of pillows and comfortable bedding to melt into after marathon days.\",\n",

They have two garages in the underground parking. The main one and there's another trap metal door the further you drive down. If you drive an SUV it will give a small height space. I drove through this trap door following another car infront of me with a reasonable allowance. I followed since I was close to the car and the door was fully open when I looked. As I was in the middle I heard a sound that was the metal door hitting the top of my Audi q7 shattering the top of my windshield. Thankfully I was not injured but my hope through this message is that people will be careful with the garage when they stay at this location.<br/>Thanks,<br/>Moira\",\n",

      "        \"review\": \"We had a great stay at this Airbnb! The host was super friendly and very responsive throughout our stay. The unit was clean, well-maintained, and comfortably fit five people. The check-in process was very clear and smooth, and overall, we’re really happy with our experience.<br/>One suggestion for the host: the checkout instructions ask guests to pile up used towels, linens, and rags in the bedroom. While it’s understandable to help the cleaning staff identify used items, I’d personally prefer if the host’s team handled that entirely to avoid any hygiene issues—especially since guests might accidentally forget something.<br/>Also worth mentioning (as other reviews have noted), there are some homeless people around the neighborhood, but this didn’t affect our stay and is, of course, outside the host’s control.<br/>Overall, we’d definitely recommend this place and would stay again!\",\n",

      "        \"review\": \"We were honestly quite disappointed with our 2-night stay, mainly because of two things. First, when we arrived, the master bedroom wasn’t clean at all. the floor was still dirty, like it hadn’t even been swept. The towels also smelled bad and we had to wash them before using them. The sofa in the living room also had an unpleasant smell which made it uncomfortable to sit on.<br/>Second, the TV wasn’t working the whole time we were there. We were told it was already having issues and still being fixed but we feel like it should have been sorted out before our check-in. We were told multiple times that someone would come by to fix it, so we waited the whole day but no one showed up. That was really frustrating.<br/>We paid the full price expecting a relaxing stay, but instead, it ended up being stressful. Please make sure the place is fully cleaned and ready before guests arrive. The thing is, the unit itself is actually nice and the view is beautiful. It just needs be maintained well.\",\n",

Once inside, the space far exceeded my expectations, with stunning views and thoughtful touches throughout.<br/>It's worth noting that some of the surrounding area faces social challenges, which are beyond the hosts’ control, just something to be aware of. That said, the secure parking and overall convenience of the location more than made up for it. <br/>I genuinely appreciated the care and effort the hosts put into making this a great stay.<br/>Thanks again, and hats off to the hosts for doing such a great job.

The area is pretty noisy at night but being downtown it should be expected. We really enjoyed our stay and would definitely stay again. Thank you Tristan\",\n",
      "      \"The location was perfect for our stay. We attended a festival at Cowboy Park which was approximately a 15 min walk from this place. There is a lot of places to eat close by and within walking distance. The parking spot and street parking are both convenient and felt safe. The instructions into the building were a little confusing but we managed. Overall, we would definitely stay again and would recommend the space.\",\n",
      "      \"Tristan’s place is fantastic! Great furnishings and comfortable beds. The location is close to wonderful restaurants and coffeehouses. It is close to lots of things to do yet tucked in a quiet street. The parking stall was very appreciated. Thanks Tristan!\",\n",
      "      \"Great value for money, the apartment was beautiful and had everything you need. Tristan was very responsive and helpful, I’d definitely stay again if I came back to Calgary\",\n",
      "      \"Our stay was wonderful, it’s a nice fancy safe place by the heart of downtown, only 5 minutes from Calgary tower and 5 to 6 minutes away from two downtown mosques in Calgary.\",\n",
      "      \"We had a wonderful stay at Tristan’s place in Calgary! The house was clean, secure, and beautifully maintained. It looked just like the photos, if not better. Tristan was an excellent host, very welcoming and quick to respond to our messages. We truly felt comfortable and well taken care of throughout our stay.<br/>Will definitely recommend this place to all our friends and family in Saskatoon!\",\n",
      "      \"Pros:Great location! Beds were comfy. very little required from us to check out which was appreciated. <br/>Con:Pictures did not meet the actual place (small apartment) The work space is in the living room right next to the only TV, Sofa and access to the balcony. So if one of you is working the other person will have to be in one of the bedrooms.\",\n",
      "      \"Very good spot, very centric.  It has been a good experience. The flat is comfortable and nice. Recommendable.<br/>Unfortunately, there was a fire alarm inspection during our stay. We couldn’t access to the rooftop.<br/>The price is a bit high comparing to other places, but it is true that is in Calgary Downtown and during the summer.\",\n",
      "      \"This place was amazing and the hosts had the two most important qualities I like to see: responsive and friendly. From the property you can get anywhere downtown in about 10 mins driving and there are a ton of things within a 5 to 10 min walk. It is in a safe neighborhood and while we were there it was quiet and peaceful. If you are looking for an affordable clean place to stay with responsive hosts then I recomend!\",\n",
      "      \"Host was very communicative and responsive. Location is awesome and the place was accurately represented in the photos. <br/>**IMPORTANT** This building is VERY strict on noise. We were threatened by a resident at 3 pm in the afternoon because we were playing music and we talked in halls. We felt like we were walking on eggshells for the remainder of our stay. This place is suitable as a landing spot for a quiet group, but I would not recommend if you’re looking for a place that feels like home.\",\n",

      "      \"I found Tristan’s place an absolute diamond of a find! It was so secure and private, in a great location walkable to the bustling streets for restaurants and shops. The apartment was pristine and beautifully furnished, the kitchen was kitted out and very well stocked. The owners were so helpful and kind also. Such good value for money and will definitely stay again when I’m back in Calgary. Couldn’t recommend more highly! :)\",\n",
      "      \"Second time staying here. Great location and awesome host. Highly recommended and definitely stay here next time!\",\n",
      "      \"The lodging matched the photos and description. We liked the apartment and the location. The price was very reasonable. We had 5 ppl stay comfortably. My reasons for not giving 5 stars is the fairly unreasonable quiet hours and the manner we were treated by other residents. And the serious amount of door locks and security was at times frustrating. It was hard to get in and out with all the keys fobs locks buttons and doors. If you intend to have a very quiet stay and few occupants this prob would be a great choice. If you wanna hang here and enjoy a few laughs in the middle of the day be prepared for noise disturbance complaints both from residents and an in house monitor system. The host was great and very good communicator. I just would not bring a group here. Beds were ok, but not great. Bathroom and kitchen very nice. Great location in Calgary. Cute place.  I’m sad we never went to the rooftop. We used the parking garage spot which was very convenient.\",\n",

My reasons for not giving 5 stars is the fairly unreasonable quiet hours and the manner we were treated by other residents. And the serious amount of door locks and security was at times frustrating. It was hard to get in and out with all the keys fobs locks buttons and doors. If you intend to have a very quiet stay and few occupants this prob would be a great choice. If you wanna hang here and enjoy a few laughs in the middle of the day be prepared for noise disturbance complaints both from residents and an in house monitor system. The host was great and very good communicator. I just would not bring a group here. Beds were ok, but not great. Bathroom and kitchen very nice. Great location in Calgary. Cute place.  I’m sad we never went to the rooftop. We used the parking garage spot which was very convenient.\",\n",

We’re so glad to hear you enjoyed the apartment, appreciated the location, and found the parking convenient.
