In the living room, you're able to log into your own accounts using the smart TV and will find cuddling up on the couch quite comfortable. The couch can be used as an additional sleeping space, and it folds out into a sofa bed, should you wish to travel in a larger group. In the bathroom, you'll find towels, shampoo/conditioner, soap, a hair dryer, and a combo bath/shower. The primary bedroom offers a queen-sized bed, lamp, shelf, and closet. It also boasts large windows which brighten up the space.  The sliding fogged doors can be closed or completely opened up to allow you to watch TV from bed.  The second bedroom offers a double bed for comfortable sleep.The space is great for those traveling or anyone living in Calgary and looking for a date night. Instead of rushing home and having to come back downtown, pack a bag and get ready in the suite. You'll be able to walk to popular favorites such as 10 Foot Henry (1 min walk), The Allium (2 min walk), Native Tongues Taqueria (3 min walk), Two Penny (1 min walk) or the Saddledome (13 min walk).  The best part?! You'll be able to skip the pricey cab ride and sleep in the next morning! Leaving you feeling refreshed. Use that extra time (and energy) to hit a fitness class (Hot Shop Yoga is just across the street!) or head to brunch to catch up with a friend."

The condo has two bedrooms, a bathroom, living room, kitchen and laundry space. \r\rThe kitchen has a dining table with seating for four, as well as all the essentials; (coffee, pots, pans, oil, salt/pepper). The kitchen and dining space flows nicely into the living area. This open floor plan makes it easy to cook, eat, relax, entertain and feel connected to the people you're travelling with. \r\rIn the living room you're able to access Netflix and will find cuddling up on the couch quite comfortable. The couch can be used as an additional sleeping space, should you wish to travel in a larger group. \r\rIn the bathroom you'll find towels, shampoo/conditioner, soap, hair dryer and a combo bath/shower. \r\rThe primary bedroom offers a queen sized bed, lamp, shelf and closet. It also boats large windows which brighten up the space.  The sliding fogged doors can be closed or completely opened up to allow you to watch TV from bed.  \r\rThe second bedroom offers a double bed, closet and dresser. \r\rThe space is great for those travelling or anyone living in Calgary and looking for a date night. Instead of rushing home and having to come back downtown, pack a bag and get ready in the suite. You'll be able to walk to popular favorites such as 10 Foot Henry (1 min walk), The Allium (2 min walk), Native Tongues Taqueria (3 min walk), Two Penny (1 min walk) or the Saddledome (13 min walk).  The best part?! You'll be able to skip the pricey cab ride and sleep in the next morning! Leaving you feeling refreshed. Use that extra time (and energy) to hit a fitness class (Hot Shop Yoga is just across the street!) or head to brunch to catch up with a friend."

      "Definite pro\u2019s<br/>Aaron was responsive, reasonable and went out his way to accommodate me during emergencies.<br/>Location was excellent, walking distance to restaurants, parks and walking trails. The unit itself was great,  well equipped and comfortable. (Sofa needs changing). <br/>Con\u2019s<br/>Since this is a property managed Airbnb, the only minor issue was, having a single point of contact as a host. \u201cCall host\u201d typically directed you to an answering service and ultimately to the host - a new experience for me staying Airbnb\u2019s.",
      "Excellent and beautifully located unit. We enjoyed our stay a lot! I recommend this place, close to the river and close to grocery shops, pharmacies, restaurants, etc!",
      "Loved the stay. Great to be around the heart of mission with the river and the restaurants it offered",
      "I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at Aaron's place. The place is clean, great furniture, nice rooms, great kitchen, and an excellent place to sit and work with a nice desk setup.  I also walked into the city regularly, to work at coffee shops. The walk is only ~15-20 minutes, which is also pleasant to get fresh air and see the city. The local area of Mission is also enjoyable if you want some food or a smaller coffee shop.<br/>The building and property are also beautiful, but the apartment I stayed in (202) is on the non-river side. I think the listing photo is a little misleading, as it showcases the river photo first, but this is not your experience in this apartment. Your keys get you access to this back area with the river, but only the grass and some used dirty lawn furniture. If you are renting this apartment for that beautiful view and outdoor experience, you are not going to get it.<br/>Still worth the stay, if you want a beautiful apartment and a well-organised AirBnB experience!",
      "Small, cozy space. Convenient and great location!",
      "This place was great! Theres a lot of great restaurants nearby and its in a quiet neighborhood. Would definitely stay again. Only issue I came across was the parking. I could not access the garage and unfortunately the issue was not resolved during my stay. It made things a bit inconvenient as I had to find street parking and then walk to the apartment. But again other than that it was nice :)",
      "This place was great for our few days in Calgary at the stampede. It was walking distance max 15min walk to the stampede and very close to excellent breakfast joints and other restaurants. The place was spacious for a one bedroom and we had an additional person sleep on the couch (not a pull out). Aaron was very responsive and quick to respond when a few items (extra towel and linens) were missing from the place. We would recommend to others!",
      "My partner and I visited Calgary for a short few days, and we had a great stay at Aaron's apartment. It is a great apartment with everything we need. The location is great, easy to walk to public transit. And there are lots of good restaurants blocks away. Aaron gives clear instructions, and the communication we had was friendly and straightforward.",
      "This is a great place to stay! Super central in the best neighbourhood with restaurants, bars, and shops in walking distance. Right next to river, which was an amazing place to walk in the heat wave. The place was clean and stylish. Bed was comfortable. Would absolutely stay again next time in Calgary!",
      "Aaron\u2019s place was great. It had everything you needed in the kitchen, laundry and bathroom (along with travel skin care samples). The condo also had a nice back yard with lawn chairs right by the Elbow river. It was a great place to hang out with our Golden.  Thanks Aaron!",
      "We loved our stay at Aaron's place and will definitely be back! Aaron was a great, responsive host and his thorough instructions were both super helpful and appreciated. Aaron's place is in a beautiful area - we felt super safe and right at home. The apartment was super clean and comfortable. Super close to restaurants and there's the river right out back and a nice park right down the road. We really enjoyed the centrality of Aaron's place - everywhere we visited was a short drive away. Overall, great place and great host!",

I also walked into the city regularly, to work at coffee shops. The walk is only ~15-20 minutes, which is also pleasant to get fresh air and see the city. The local area of Mission is also enjoyable if you want some food or a smaller coffee shop.<br/>The building and property are also beautiful, but the apartment I stayed in (202) is on the non-river side. I think the listing photo is a little misleading, as it showcases the river photo first, but this is not your experience in this apartment. Your keys get you access to this back area with the river, but only the grass and some used dirty lawn furniture. If you are renting this apartment for that beautiful view and outdoor experience, you are not going to get it.<br/>Still worth the stay, if you want a beautiful apartment and a well-organised AirBnB experience!",

      "This was such a great place to stay.  We really appreciate Kyle, Andrew, and everyone at KYAN properties for having us. Everything was as advertised, and comes with a great view of downtown Calgary. We don't visit the city too often, but when we do, we'll be looking out for your listings. Would reccomend! <br/>-Paul",
      "The place was clean, quiet, and centrally located.  Kyle provided clear instructions for accessing the condo. Kyle checked in with us during our stay.",
      "Fantastic place to stay in downtown core with beautiful views",
      "Well\u2026 I stayed for 1 week on this apartment. The apartment was dirty and dusty. It has a great view of downtown, but it is not worthy the price I paid. <br/>I had some trouble to park the car, since there was no instruction saying the parking spot number. <br/>The responsible person took some  time to answer and I had to stay inside of the car until I figure out what was the parking number. After 12 hours car trip(I was really tired).  He was very rude at first, saying I didn\u2019t read the manual with the informations, which I did and later he confessed there was a \u201cbug\u201d in the system and didn\u2019t show me the full information about parking. <br/>Note: if you have children, be careful because the bedroom doors have very sharp metal edges and can hurt a kid very easily and get your clothing stuck when you\u2019re walking by. <br/>Other than that.. the apartment is well located. Garage gate keys need to be replaced. Not working very well. <br/>Peaceful place.",
      "I was in the city attending a wedding. Location was perfect. Everything you need is on your doorstep or a short walk away.<br/>Apartment was on the 19th floor offering AMAZING views over the city.<br/>Any issues and concerns I had were answered and sorted straight away. Great support.",
      "it was a very nice place & location!",

        "review": "Well\u2026 I stayed for 1 week on this apartment. The apartment was dirty and dusty. It has a great view of downtown, but it is not worthy the price I paid. <br/>I had some trouble to park the car, since there was no instruction saying the parking spot number. <br/>The responsible person took some  time to answer and I had to stay inside of the car until I figure out what was the parking number. After 12 hours car trip(I was really tired).  He was very rude at first, saying I didn\u2019t read the manual with the informations, which I did and later he confessed there was a \u201cbug\u201d in the system and didn\u2019t show me the full information about parking. <br/>Note: if you have children, be careful because the bedroom doors have very sharp metal edges and can hurt a kid very easily and get your clothing stuck when you\u2019re walking by. <br/>Other than that.. the apartment is well located. Garage gate keys need to be replaced. Not working very well. <br/>Peaceful place.",
        "host_response": "When Jonathan mentioned the unit was dusty, we immediately offered to send a cleaner out to resolve the issue \u2014 an offer that was declined \u2014 and there were no further concerns raised after that point.<br/>Regarding the garage fob and the metal edges on the doors: unfortunately, we were not made aware of these issues during Jonathans' stay. Had we been informed, we would have addressed them right away. We're always more than willing to resolve problems promptly when given the opportunity to do so, and we truly value open communication with our guests."

      "I enjoyed my stay here. Clean linens and equipment. <br/>Excellent and clear directives. <br/>The building is in quite a strategic location which enables you have an excellent view of downtown. <br/>It\u2019s smaller than I expected but overall it\u2019s cozy. <br/>I look forward to spending time here if have to visit Calgary again",
      "We absolutely loved staying in this apartment.  We had everything we needed, the apartment itself was immaculate and in a great location.  We loved the views of the city and sitting out on the balcony. We probably spent more time in the apartment than we usually would just because we loved being in there so much. Everything went very smoothly and we wouldn\u2019t hesitate to stay there again.",
      "I had a wonderful stay at this beautiful home! It was spotless, comfortable, and had everything I needed for my visit. Kyle & Andrew were amazing hosts. friendly, responsive, and thoughtful throughout my stay. The location was great and made my time in Calgary even better. Everything was perfect, and I would definitely stay here again. Highly recommend this beautiful home!",
      "Our stay was absolutely excellent! Communication with the hosts was very quick and clear from the start \u2014 the check-in and check-out instructions were easy to follow. One time, we accidentally left one of our keys inside the apartment, and they responded immediately, helping us right away. We also forgot an item at check-out, and they kindly returned it to us in perfect condition with no extra charge. Everything was handled so well! Highly recommend this place.",
      "My second stay in Calgary. This apartment was better than the previous I had.  It is situated far better in a more cozy area compared to SE Calgary.   Would rent this place again.",
      "This is the second time staying at this location, very walkable and accesible, central to many restaurants. It was a bit noisy due to the stampede tent but that will not be a problem until next year. The hosts are great and understanding even after I lost the key-fobs, obviously I needed to pay the replacements. I like the alternative option of calling someone to give access to the condo. I have not seen that anywhere else.",
      "Great location, close to both downtown and beltline. Lots of nice cafes and restaurants. Smooth checkin, hosts are very responsive. <br/>The couch is not comfortable  and there are no blackout blinds so it is bright at night. Recommend carrying eye marks",
      "very convenient place to stay.  everything was walking distance and made our stay less stressful. beautiful views",
      "I would definitely recommend this air bnb to anyone. I felt so at home, they had extra things I didn\u2019t even think to pack. The air bnb was just beautiful. When I had to leave they were really good with letting me know what I could do to help out (where to bring garbage/recycle etc). I will definitely book with them again if and when I travel back to Calgary.",
      "Kyle did a great job providing all the instructions before, during and after my stays. Great place! I enjoyed my time at Kyle\u2019s place.",
      "Enjoyed my stay there. Would love to come back. The apartment has beautiful interior and view. It\u2019s super clean and cozy.",
      "The location was fantastic\u2014perfect for exploring downtown Calgary, with plenty of great restaurants nearby. The hosts were also very responsive, which we appreciated. However, the listing was a bit misleading\u2014the space felt smaller than in the photos, and there was no mountain view as advertised. The main downside was the comfort, as the bedding (mattress and pillows) felt a bit worn out, and the couch wasn\u2019t very usable. Overall, it was okay for a short stay, but not the best option for those looking for a truly comfortable experience.",
      "I had a fantastic stay at this Airbnb! The place was impeccably clean, spacious, and cozy, with a perfect layout that made it feel like a home away from home. The host was very responsive. Definitely returning!!",
      "I really recommend staying at one of Kyle & Andrew\u2019s properties. The place was absolutely beautiful with city views and so close to many restaurants, bars, grocery stores, and shopping. It was the perfect place for a weekend getaway!  Kyle and Andrew are very responsive to your messages and make the check in instructions clear and easy. They messaged me daily to make sure our accommodation was meeting our expectations which I really appreciated! Plus the underground parking was so nice to have for our stay! I will definitely be staying at one of their accommodations again in the future!",
      "Kyle was great, definitely recommend anyone visiting the area",
      "The apartment was just as pictures, easy to get around, and the parking was handy. Nice balcony and seating.<br/>The hosts can't do anything about it, but there were quite a few homeless in the alleys around the apartment block, in general there are a lot of homeless in the city though.  Nice touches like bssic supplies and coffee pods<br/>The hosts were very keen to make sure everything was great, with frequent communications and clear instructions.<br/>As other guests have mentioned, the couch is not comfortable and could probably benefit from being replaced.  The other thing that would make the place even better would be some blackout blinds or curtains in the bedroom  as it was very light and this disturbed our sleep.",
      "Great unit exactly what you see in the photos!",
      "Very cozy and very reassuring that the hosts checked in via chat often.",
      "It was great place. Lots of restaurants and things to do, all within walking distance. It\u2019s a great place to stay in Calgary.",
      "Beautiful place with a great view. Loved the design. Great to have parking included. Enjoyed it very much.",
      "Great place right downtown. They have a coffee machine and tea which was really nice. The building has a small gym which is very convenient.",
      "Great apartment! <br/>Ultra clean, super well-equipped, very well-decorated.<br/>If you're looking for a city apartment experience, that's perfect!<br/>Kyle was very proactive and quick to answer our questions. <br/>Totally recommend!",

Nice touches like bssic supplies and coffee pods<br/>The hosts were very keen to make sure everything was great, with frequent communications and clear instructions.<br/>As other guests have mentioned, the couch is not comfortable and could probably benefit from being replaced.

      "Wonderful stay! The place was exactly as described, spotlessly clean, and the host was responsive and helpful. Check-in was smooth, location was perfect for our needs, and all amenities worked great. Would absolutely stay here again and highly recommend to others. Thank you for a fantastic experience!",
      "Chloe & Jason were phenomenal! Incredibly smooth check in and very thorough PDF doc outlining everything for the condo from check in & check out to amenities and even recommended spots! The condo itself was perfect and made for a wonderful stay! Would highly recommend and will definitely be back! Thanks again!",
      "Large and comfortable apartment in Calgary.<br/>We had to book the apartment very short notice due to a cancelation we received.<br/>This was not an issue and we are very grateful for the great Organisation.<br/>The bed in the big bedroom is large and very comfortable.<br/>The view from the apartment is just amazing.<br/>We really enjoyed the stay and can only recommend.",
      "Very organized and looked exactly like the pictures. The communication was very open and available ALOT of details and instructions. Overall great stay I would stay here again. Thanks for being great Hosts Jason and Chloe.",
      "I stayed here for 5 nights a my Mom. Always a treat getting to spend time with her, and staying at Chloe and Jason\u2019s for the bill perfectly. <br/>There\u2019s a lot going on in the neighborhood. Good restaurants and bars, real businesses, and other residential projects. I was able to walk to my morning meetings downtown in no time. 17th Street is also just a quick walk with more bars and restaurants and even a pharmacy. <br/>The suite is generous and beautiful. It\u2019s very well designed and the two balconies face South and East. This isn\u2019t your typical condo project - you don\u2019t have to leave your room to change your mind :)<br/>Chloe and Jason made sure everything was taken care of and responded inside of 10 minutes and sometimes immediately. It was very reliable communication.  <br/>Plenty of pillows and comfortable bedding to melt into after marathon days.",
      "I wanted to share my stay in this apartment. The apartment was fabulous. The booking went smooth. I give them 5/5 but I faced a scary experience with the building itself. They have two garages in the underground parking. The main one and there's another trap metal door the further you drive down. If you drive an SUV it will give a small height space. I drove through this trap door following another car infront of me with a reasonable allowance. I followed since I was close to the car and the door was fully open when I looked. As I was in the middle I heard a sound that was the metal door hitting the top of my Audi q7 shattering the top of my windshield. Thankfully I was not injured but my hope through this message is that people will be careful with the garage when they stay at this location.<br/>Thanks,<br/>Moira",
      "What a great view!! We enjoyed this condo and super easy to get around downtown",
      "Great place for the price! We enjoyed our stay and the views of both the mountains and the city skyline. Comfortable furniture as well.",
      "The place is extremely beautiful, very clean and perfect location. The view is extraordinary and we are looking forward to come back. We strongly recomand it to others",
      "We had a great time at this location. Everything was really close, and the view was unforgettable.",
      "We had a great stay at this Airbnb! The host was super friendly and very responsive throughout our stay. The unit was clean, well-maintained, and comfortably fit five people. The check-in process was very clear and smooth, and overall, we\u2019re really happy with our experience.<br/>One suggestion for the host: the checkout instructions ask guests to pile up used towels, linens, and rags in the bedroom. While it\u2019s understandable to help the cleaning staff identify used items, I\u2019d personally prefer if the host\u2019s team handled that entirely to avoid any hygiene issues\u2014especially since guests might accidentally forget something.<br/>Also worth mentioning (as other reviews have noted), there are some homeless people around the neighborhood, but this didn\u2019t affect our stay and is, of course, outside the host\u2019s control.<br/>Overall, we\u2019d definitely recommend this place and would stay again!",
      "We were honestly quite disappointed with our 2-night stay, mainly because of two things. First, when we arrived, the master bedroom wasn\u2019t clean at all. the floor was still dirty, like it hadn\u2019t even been swept. The towels also smelled bad and we had to wash them before using them. The sofa in the living room also had an unpleasant smell which made it uncomfortable to sit on.<br/>Second, the TV wasn\u2019t working the whole time we were there. We were told it was already having issues and still being fixed but we feel like it should have been sorted out before our check-in. We were told multiple times that someone would come by to fix it, so we waited the whole day but no one showed up. That was really frustrating.<br/>We paid the full price expecting a relaxing stay, but instead, it ended up being stressful. Please make sure the place is fully cleaned and ready before guests arrive. The thing is, the unit itself is actually nice and the view is beautiful. It just needs be maintained well.",
      "This property was exactly what I needed during my stay in Calgary: spacious, well-equipped, and ideally located. <br/>While the check-in process may seem a bit tricky at first, the hosts have provided an incredibly detailed and clear PDF guide that makes everything smooth and straightforward. Once inside, the space far exceeded my expectations, with stunning views and thoughtful touches throughout.<br/>It's worth noting that some of the surrounding area faces social challenges, which are beyond the hosts\u2019 control, just something to be aware of. That said, the secure parking and overall convenience of the location more than made up for it. <br/>I genuinely appreciated the care and effort the hosts put into making this a great stay.<br/>Thanks again, and hats off to the hosts for doing such a great job. Keep it up!",
      "One of the Best building in Downtown area, the best view and location",
      "Chloe and Jason were good hosts I\u2019ll visit again.",
      "Overall, the room is spacious and beautiful.The response was very quick and the support was very kind.The location is also very good, and you can walk to the nearby supermarkets and restaurants.<br/>The minor complaints are that there was no hair dryer, Netflix could not be watched in the designated way, there were no tissues, and the neighbors and surroundings were noisy until the middle of the night on Saturday night.<br/>However, there is no particular dissatisfaction.<br/>We have a very good place to stay.",

Always a treat getting to spend time with her, and staying at Chloe and Jason\u2019s for the bill perfectly. <br/>There\u2019s a lot going on in the neighborhood. Good restaurants and bars, real businesses, and other residential projects. I was able to walk to my morning meetings downtown in no time. 17th Street is also just a quick walk with more bars and restaurants and even a pharmacy. <br/>The suite is generous and beautiful. It\u2019s very well designed and the two balconies face South and East. This isn\u2019t your typical condo project - you don\u2019t have to leave your room to change your mind :)<br/>Chloe and Jason made sure everything was taken care of and responded inside of 10 minutes and sometimes immediately. It was very reliable communication.  <br/>Plenty of pillows and comfortable bedding to melt into after marathon days.",

        "review": "I wanted to share my stay in this apartment. The apartment was fabulous. The booking went smooth. I give them 5/5 but I faced a scary experience with the building itself. They have two garages in the underground parking. The main one and there's another trap metal door the further you drive down. If you drive an SUV it will give a small height space. I drove through this trap door following another car infront of me with a reasonable allowance. I followed since I was close to the car and the door was fully open when I looked. As I was in the middle I heard a sound that was the metal door hitting the top of my Audi q7 shattering the top of my windshield. Thankfully I was not injured but my hope through this message is that people will be careful with the garage when they stay at this location.<br/>Thanks,<br/>Moira",

The check-in process was very clear and smooth, and overall, we\u2019re really happy with our experience.<br/>One suggestion for the host: the checkout instructions ask guests to pile up used towels, linens, and rags in the bedroom. While it\u2019s understandable to help the cleaning staff identify used items, I\u2019d personally prefer if the host\u2019s team handled that entirely to avoid any hygiene issues\u2014especially since guests might accidentally forget something.<br/>Also worth mentioning (as other reviews have noted), there are some homeless people around the neighborhood, but this didn\u2019t affect our stay and is, of course, outside the host\u2019s control.<br/>Overall, we\u2019d definitely recommend this place and would stay again!",

        "review": "We were honestly quite disappointed with our 2-night stay, mainly because of two things. First, when we arrived, the master bedroom wasn\u2019t clean at all. the floor was still dirty, like it hadn\u2019t even been swept. The towels also smelled bad and we had to wash them before using them. The sofa in the living room also had an unpleasant smell which made it uncomfortable to sit on.<br/>Second, the TV wasn\u2019t working the whole time we were there. We were told it was already having issues and still being fixed but we feel like it should have been sorted out before our check-in. We were told multiple times that someone would come by to fix it, so we waited the whole day but no one showed up. That was really frustrating.<br/>We paid the full price expecting a relaxing stay, but instead, it ended up being stressful. Please make sure the place is fully cleaned and ready before guests arrive. The thing is, the unit itself is actually nice and the view is beautiful. It just needs be maintained well.",

Once inside, the space far exceeded my expectations, with stunning views and thoughtful touches throughout.<br/>It's worth noting that some of the surrounding area faces social challenges, which are beyond the hosts\u2019 control, just something to be aware of. That said, the secure parking and overall convenience of the location more than made up for it. <br/>I genuinely appreciated the care and effort the hosts put into making this a great stay.<br/>Thanks again, and hats off to the hosts for doing such a great job.

      "Really neat apartment, super comfortable beds and kitchen was stocked with all the equipment you\u2019d need to cook a nice home made meal. Benji was super responsive to our last minute booking - we didn\u2019t booked until 7:30pm at night due to a fire in another Airbnb we were meant to be staying in, super grateful the apartment was ready for us to check in straight away and wrapped with Benji\u2019s response time",
      "Great place in a great area of downtown Calgary. Lots to do near by, and the view was nice from the patio. <br/>It was clean, and pristine. Benji was responsive& helpful. <br/>Definitely would stay again",
      "As described. Could have been a bit cleaner. Everything worked as needed. The location is close to transit options (light rail or bus) to get anywhere in the city. Some great restaurants nearby.",
      "Overall a very good experience. Cozy, comfortable, and private. Really liked all the natural light and the ability to get fresh air from the balcony. And it felt very safe. Would highly recommend",
      "Benji was an excellent host. Always there when needed and promptly addressing any issue that arose. The location is close to many restaurants and great shopping areas in downtown. The streets are less busy than the core. Travelling with a car requires a little pre-planning but nothing exceptional",
      "A nice flat and Benji was responsive but the whole flat needs a really good clean and prepared properly for guests - used towels removed, clean cutlery/crockery provided and bathroom (especially toilet) cleaned.",
      "We travelled from Australia and had a great stay! The place was clean, cozy, and exactly as described. The central location made it super easy to explore the city\u2014everything was just a short walk away. The host was friendly and responsive. Highly recommend!",
      "Loved our stay, was a convenient and clean apartment in a fab location. <br/>Benji was a good host and communicated very well, thank you Benji \ud83d\ude0a",
      "The stay was great really easy to contact Benji. Nice and close to transport and the convention center.",

      "Great place to stay. Clean. Walkable distance from a lot of places. Would recommend.",
      "Great spot, very central and within walking distance to most things! Benji was easy to get in contact with.",
      "Although we only stayed at Benji\u2019s place one night he was very responsive and the place was very nice! Excellent stay!",
      "Found a wet bath towel in washer, and duvet came without cover. Host was responsive and location is convenient.",
      "Awesome location, and it was very clean. The host is easy to get a hold of and he made it very easy to find and get in!",
      "Great stay! I was there for 2 nights for a wedding and didn\u2019t have any complaints. Great location!",

      "The place was in a great location downtown Calgary! Benji was extremely friendly and helpful! I would definitely stay here again!",
      "Beautiful apartment, nice building and it felt safe.<br/>However, it was quite dirty. Especially the bathroom (stains on wall, sink and in toilet; fake lashes on faucet etc.). Sheets and towels were still in the dryer. Had to make beds ourselves.",
      "Great experience. Benji is a very nice person. He respond messages quickly and very easy to communicate with. Location is very good too, close to train station, Safeway and restaurants. Highly recommended Benji\u2019s place.",
      "Great space. Clean and well taken care of.  <br/>I\u2019ll be back",
      "The most comfortable beds and pillows I have ever slept on.  What a wonderful stay."

      "I\u2019m a local Calgarian and stayed here for a month. The location was great \u2014 walkable to everything I love about this city. I didn\u2019t hear any noise from neighbouring units through the walls or ceiling during my stay. For anyone who\u2019s noise-sensitive, you can hear some street noise and trains, but earplugs helped. The building felt safe, and there\u2019s a security guard on site. The kitchen had everything I needed to cook meals, and this was the cleanest Airbnb I\u2019ve ever stayed in. I would love to live in this building and would definitely stay here again.",
      "I loved this place and will definitely be back!<br/>The host was fantastic, everything was clean, and access was super easy. Having parking available \u2014 especially in downtown \u2014 was a huge plus.<br/>I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a comfortable and convenient stay!",
      "very responsive host and large, clean suite. suite well stocked. location being right downtown was not ideal for families with young kids, not alot of activities/parks for young kids. the pool was enjoyed by the kids.",
      "A beautiful, spacious and conveniently located condo. The gym and pool are nice additions and the condo is very well equipped with everything you could<br/>need for a comfortable stay.",
      "I used to live in Calgary and this is one of the nicest, cleanest, and perfect bnb's / apartment I have ever stayed at in YYC! From the 2 bedrooms, to the huge balcony, pristine kitchen with all needed appliances and utensils, washer/dryer, hair dryer, 2 bathrooms, and overall extremely luxury feeling! I felt very safe with the 24/7 concierge. The neighbourhood itself felt very safe and friendly located conveniently downtown. Overall I cannot recommend this place more. If you desire a luxury, cozy home feeling, and want to experience there DT life of Calgary this is the place to book! Will definitely be back and cannot wait to book again! To also add, the hosts were extremely accommodating and allowed me to check in early, thank you both again for a great stay in Calgary!",
      "Extremely easy check in. Michelle was more than flexible with our late arrival time. Would definitely stay here again.",
      "This was our second time staying here.  We really enjoy the area, lots of things to do, good restaurants and shopping all within easy walking distance.  The apartment was very clean as before and well stocked with all the basics.  We enjoyed the large balcony and large windows with great views.  Will stay again next time we\u2019re in Calgary.",
      "This is a really nice place. The pics dont do the apartment justice. Great neighbourhood too. I wish I had more time to explore the area.",
      "We had a wonderful time staying at Michelle\u2019s for Stampede. The condo was in a great location, spacious and matched the listing perfectly. I would absolutely book again!",
      "Very central within downtown. Michelle & Mo were super responsive Hosts. Home was beautiful, modern and clean. Would recommend and stay here again!",
      "Very nice place, great location downtown close to all the restaurants and pubs. So much to do, Uber\u2019s are always around and scooters as well.",
      "Great location, just parked the car & walked everywhere.  We were pleasantly surprised by the items in the kitchen-equipment & some basic items for use.",
      "Wonderful stay, the apartment was beautiful, very well kept with thoughtful additions Thankyou",
      "Michelle and Mo were fantastic\u2014very responsive and attentive and helpful! The apartment was clean, well stocked, and in a great location!",
      "Accommodations were ideal for us. Location was perfect and we could walk pretty much everywhere. The unit is well stocked with essentials and more, and whatever was lacking was replenished pretty much immediately once the host was notified. The only thing not up to par was the gym downstairs- the bike was not rideable as the pedal crank was broken, dumbbells were minimal, even the barbell plates were unevenly numbered (??) and we couldn\u2019t open the window for fresh air. Michelle had better weights and bike in the unit itself!<br/>I would definitely return the next time I\u2019m in Calgary!",
      "Michelle\u2019s place was pristine, beautiful and thoughtfully appointed. Great view and lot\u2019s of sunshine. Aesthetically decorated home.A lot of care had been taken to make the guest feel right at home. We easily found everything that we needed on our holiday.",
      "The floor to ceiling windows were great, wonderful views of the city from main room and both bedrooms.   Location was only a few blocks from the +15 and easy walking to restaurants and shopping.  Host was helpful and quick to respond to messages.  Would definitely stay again when in Calgary.",
      "Great space have stayed before and will stay again. Place is immaculate, highly recommend",

For anyone who\u2019s noise-sensitive, you can hear some street noise and trains, but earplugs helped. The building felt safe, and there\u2019s a security guard on site. The kitchen had everything I needed to cook meals, and this was the cleanest Airbnb I\u2019ve ever stayed in. I would love to live in this building and would definitely stay here again.",

From the 2 bedrooms, to the huge balcony, pristine kitchen with all needed appliances and utensils, washer/dryer, hair dryer, 2 bathrooms, and overall extremely luxury feeling! I felt very safe with the 24/7 concierge. The neighbourhood itself felt very safe and friendly located conveniently downtown. Overall I cannot recommend this place more. If you desire a luxury, cozy home feeling, and want to experience there DT life of Calgary this is the place to book! Will definitely be back and cannot wait to book again! To also add, the hosts were extremely accommodating and allowed me to check in early, thank you both again for a great stay in Calgary!",

We did have to wait 25 minutes to be let inside as host wasn\u2019t receiving or answering our buzzer but we were finally in and happy to be there. Amazing location.",
      "he stay was excellent. The place was very clean, comfortable, and exactly as shown in the photos.

I would definitely stay here again and highly recommend it to anyone visiting the area.",

The host was very nice and quickly respond to any questions I had .",
      "What a fantastic stay! Cami's apartment was absolutely superb and exceeded all my expectations. The place was spotless, beautifully decorated, and had everything I could possibly need. The location was also amazing, making it easy to get around and explore Calgary. Cami was a wonderful host\u2014responsive and a pleasure to communicate with. I can't recommend this place enough and would definitely stay here again on my next visit to Calgary.",
      "Nothing short of excellent. The host is amazing to deal with and quick with responses. Very caring and reasonable.. I ran out of toilet paper and messaged the host and she told me that I could get some and she\u2019ll reimburse the difference which she did. <br/>Other than that the place speaks for itself. Very clean, cozy and has everything you need. Great experience :)",

Cami was a great host, and I\u2019d definitely stay here again. Highly recommended!",
      "The apartment was fine but the access was not satisfactory. Only one access token was supplied for two adults. Made it very difficult to coordinate our business. I requested an additional token but the landlord wouldn't accommodate me.",
      "This was my first airbnb. Was a great place. Cami was fast to respond to any questions or concerns. It was clean and comfortable beds. Starbucks right across the street.  Lots of restaurants and pubs on the surrounding blocks. <br/>Only clean up was dishes and to take the garbage out. <br/>**door to garbage room is locked, make sure to take it out before you lock up to leave the condo.  <br/>Would book here again.",

The Condo was very clean and met our expectations! <br/>Was right in the downtown area over looking the downtown . So pretty at night looking at the city . We loved the lights and seeing the tower turn different colours every night . Restaurants in walking distance . Would definitely stay here again !<br/>Thanks again for a great experience!<br/>Julie",
      "Loved the location and the food hall across the street with many different options of food to eat from. The Irish Pub was also very good. So many options within walking distance and a cozy little place for a family of 4 ! The only issue I ran into was needing a key fob to even enter the building so I had to wait for someone to let me in as well as use their fob for the elevator, which only goes to their floor or parking. So walking down/up a few flights of stairs to get the the Airbnb was a bit out of the way with kids but it was fine. Camis place has the best view of the city! furniture was very comfortable and she had all amenities available. Great first time in Calgary!",

      "Awesome place in a great location! Close to shops, restaurants, and all the cool spots.<br/>Cami was super responsive and made everything easy. Our 4-day stay truly felt like a home away from home. We\u2019d absolutely come back again!",

We also found it very comfortable and super clean. It has everything, so if you don\u2019t feel like going out, it\u2019s easy to cook a meal\u2026 in short it just felt like home, while being in the middle of the city.

So many options within walking distance and a cozy little place for a family of 4 ! The only issue I ran into was needing a key fob to even enter the building so I had to wait for someone to let me in as well as use their fob for the elevator, which only goes to their floor or parking. So walking down/up a few flights of stairs to get the the Airbnb was a bit out of the way with kids but it was fine. Camis place has the best view of the city! furniture was very comfortable and she had all amenities available. Great first time in Calgary!",

      "We had a wonderful stay! The apartment was clean, centrally located and had everything we needed for our 2 night stay. The check-in instructions were easy to follow and it was nice to have a parking space downtown. <br/>The window in the bedroom was unfortunately still broken and in need of a clean. That didn\u2019t take away from our trip however and we really enjoyed our stay.",
      "Location! Across the street is several awesome restaurants and bars and only a short walk to Stephen Ave for more great dining and shopping. Check in and out was smooth and easy. Hosts were very responsive and friendly. Condo was very clean and great view. Would stay again. Thank you!",
      "I stayed in this two-bedroom apartment in Calgary for two nights, and it was an excellent experience. The photos represent the apartment very accurately, so what you see is exactly what you get. The place was very clean, and the hosts provided clear instructions that made both check-in and check-out quick and easy. Communication was smooth throughout my stay, the hosts were very responsive and helpful.<br/>Overall, I was very happy with my time here and would not hesitate to book again in the future. Highly recommended!",
      "Very responsive team. There was no iron and the next day they delivered a steamer. Nice!<br/>The place has a bedroom that has no windows meaning no light in. I took that one and was wonderful to sleep there after a busy day. <br/>Nice and well equipped kitchen. <br/>Cleaned and well maintained bathroom and wash room. <br/>I really liked the secured system to get in  and out the building and the apartment.",
      "The apartment is a very spacious, well-equipped, and close to many restaurants and pubs. Downtown Calgary (8th Ave.)  is only 10 mins. away on foot, and Prince's island 25 min.<br/>The hosts were very reactive and helpful whenever needed, we could even check in earlier than expected.<br/>I can only recommend this apartment for anyone (1-4 persons) visiting the Calgary downtown area.",
      "Great location and very well equipped apartment. We felt right at home. The only negative is that there are some grumpy fulltime residents that grumbled about \"short-timers.\"",
      "The apartment is amazing, really clean and has everything in it, wonderful location, a Starbucks just across the street. The stay was at my last vacation in Canada, totally worth it, totally 10/10, would recommend to anyone.",
      "It\u2019s such a cute place! Personally I love the big windows for some sun time. The location was really good. We were able to walk everywhere we wanted. Close to restaurants and the tower. Also, the whole team was so great and very responsive. Would definitely come back again.",
      "I had a great stay in Calgary! The hosts were very quick with communication and were very accommodating with my request for an earlier check-in. The place was clean and had all amenities described. The location is great for access to downtown. The apartment was quiet and secure. I would say that there are some signs of wear and tear of the apartment such as a cracked window, broken closet, broken fridge drawer, but that did not impact our stay and the hosts are working on getting these things repaired. Would stay again!",
      "Although they were a bit flexible with the check-in time, there were some minor issues:<br/>- There was a big crack on the bedroom window, which is really dangerous.<br/>- Despite charging a cleaning fee, they asked us to take out the trash, wash and dry the towels =))<br/>- The unit gets VERY hot during the sunny days in Calgary because the AC is not working at all.<br/>Maybe, overall, it was an alright place for a short stay, especially if you're not in the unit from early morning to late night.",
      "Such a great location! Close to everything you need, hosts were super responsive and friendly. Would definitely recommend!",
      "Place is great; loved it. It has everything, and it\u2019s close to anywhere you need. Will definitely stay there again.",
      "Location is great with lots nearby. Property in dire need of repairs. HVAC heated all day resulting on temps of 27C  fighting with portable air conditioner. 2 of 3 outlets in bedroom not working and \"fixed\" with the addition of an eztension cord. Broken windor in bedroom. Hosts were responsive to issues but not fixed while we were there.",
      "- Great place & Location, very peaceful <br/>- Loaded with supplies<br/>- Helpful & Responsive Hosts<br/>- Comfy Beds<br/>Only drawback was when we arrived, there were \ud83d\udca9 stains on the toilet seat but they took care of that after. Also the shower drain kept on clogging up, had to keep pouring Drain O to clear it up which was annoying.<br/>Overall it was a great place to stay at & would definitely rent again!",

      "Had a nice stay at Jesse\u2019s condo. I booked last minute and had a really seamless check in process. The space was clean and well stocked including things like cooking oil and spices. I deducted a star because I found the bed to be very soft to the point of discomfort while sleeping. Otherwise this was a 5 star stay in a great location with a great host.",
      "Only downside is that getting into the parking lot is mildly inconvenient with the remote needed from inside the apartment. Other than that the place is perfect and a great price.",
      "We had a lovely stay at Jesse\u2019s place. The condo is very comfortable and in an excellent location. Jesse is quite possibly the most responsive host that I have dealt with!  We had absolutely no concerns and would be happy to stay there again \u2026",
      "Jesse's place was great and the detailed instructions for getting into the building and parking were excellent. The location was perfect, right in the heart of downtown with excellent restaurants nearby. the Food Hall across the street was very handy and yummy.",
      "Fantastic condo in a great location and at a great price. Very responsive and friendly host. Everything you need is provided. Parking was a big plus. We\u2019ll be back for sure.",
      "This is such a great location to explore Calgary. The apartment was spotless, had everything we needed and the coffee was great! Our host\u2019s communication was superb and we couldn\u2019t have wanted anything more.",
      "Really enjoyed our short stay! Great location, apartment is very spacious, lots of sunlight. We were positively surprised with kitchen - you can find not only normally provided staff like glasses and plates, but spices, sugar, cooking oil, simple things which could make it way more convenient if you like to cook. Communication with Jesse was great as well - very helpful(I made sure to ask stupid questions:)) and friendly. Would recommend!",
      "Great stay! Jesse was very responsive and checked in to make sure everything was going smoothly. The apartment is in a great location\u2014just a short walk to downtown, with plenty of restaurants and coffee shops nearby. It also has a nice view of the city skyline. The space was clean, well-equipped, and had everything I needed for a comfortable stay. Highly recommend!",
      "Beyond what I have listed in my ratings about the location, cleanliness, and host responsiveness I wanted to highlight that they beds were very comfortable and the pillows were a premium variety (none of that folding pillows in half to get a decent head lift lol). Great stay, completely as advertised and right in the heart of downtown - close to working spaces, excellent food and drink options, and also to the Stampede grounds. Fantastic stay!",
      "Clean place, exactly as described. Thoughtful details that a lot of other hosts miss. Location couldn't be better. Jesse is a very responsive and accommodating host. Would stay here again without hesitation.",
      "Although I had sent my id for the host twice, my access was not activated because of id request!<br/>The condo was clean , but the second bedroom was actually a den without walls or window",

      "Great place to stay in downtown Calgary, great view, awesome place to stay, and very helpful host. We had a little of trouble getting in (totally my fault, didn\u2019t read the instructions well enough) and Jesse was extremely helpful and made sure we made it in. Very nice furniture, comfortable beds, and was extremely clean! Would definitely recommend a stay!",

      "Anna was an awesome host, and her Airbnb was just what we were looking for! Excellent location, and a beautiful view. Thanks!",
      "Anna's condo was a delightful addition to our trip. We felt very secure in her building. Her 12th floor condo gave us a view of Calgary we'd never seen before and we were shutterbugs trying to capture the Calgary Tower and what we called 'the cube building' that showed colourful 'rain drops' and other designs as night fell and lights came on. The view overshadowed any concerns about the lack of window coverings in the livingroom, as we would have left them open anyway. The deck gave us another experience as we heard the city from a fresh perspective. We really enjoyed our stay at Anna's place had everything we needed and more, and hopefully we can stay there again on our next trip to Calgary.",
      "I stayed at Anna's place for 5 nights as part of a work trip. Anna was very accomodating with check-in due to my late flight arrival and was responsive throughout.

The location is very central making getting around city super easy. Overall I'd highly recommend!",

      "We had a great two days in Calgary.  Anna's place played a large part in that. There was a small hiccup regarding a key fob when we first got there, but that was quickly resolved. <br/>The location was fine, we did go to 17th Street the first night for dinner, and downtown for the second night. <br/>The view of the downtown skyline was superb!<br/>If I found myself in Calgary again, I'd definitely try to book this property again.",

Her 12th floor condo gave us a view of Calgary we'd never seen before and we were shutterbugs trying to capture the Calgary Tower and what we called 'the cube building' that showed colourful 'rain drops' and other designs as night fell and lights came on. The view overshadowed any concerns about the lack of window coverings in the livingroom, as we would have left them open anyway. The deck gave us another experience as we heard the city from a fresh perspective. We really enjoyed our stay at Anna's place had everything we needed and more, and hopefully we can stay there again on our next trip to Calgary.",

The private parking space also made things a lot easier. <br/>Jonathan was always on hand to help with anything we were unsure about. <br/>The house was clean, with all the essentials that we required and we truly felt at home! The view of Calgary and the mountains was also incredible!  <br/>Would totally recommend this place to anyone looking for somewhere to stay.",
      "WOW!   From booking to checkout, Jonathan was awesome.  VERY responsive.  The condo was even better than advertised!   My husband & I were there for a rotary conference at the BMO center.  Friends paid 3 times what we paid for a hotel room.  Location, price, cleanliness, security & Jonathan made our week perfect!  Would definitely recommend & would rent again if we ever come back to Calgary!",
      "Beautiful clean condo in a great location. Everything was as described and very close to a lot of restaurants and cafes.

      "I had such a wonderful stay at Jonathan\u2019s 24th-story condo! The view is absolutely stunning, and the location couldn\u2019t be better,just steps away from fantastic restaurants like Bridgette bar and sweet Loretta\u2018s. Having secure convenient underground parking made everything so easy.<br/>The condo itself is beautifully appointed with everything you could possibly need. It was spotlessly clean, with crisp white towels and linens that made it feel like a luxury hotel. It\u2019s the perfect space for up to two people.<br/>The building amenities are great,the pool may be on the smaller side, but it was more than sufficient for a refreshing dip. What really stood out were the thoughtful little touches Jonathan put into the space. His collection of retro cassette tapes and the ghetto blaster added such a fun, personal vibe and put a smile on my face throughout my stay.<br/>Overall, a fantastic experience,I\u2019d definitely recommend this condo to anyone looking for comfort, convenience, and character.",

Everything is in walking distance, including grocery\u2019s only a couple of blocks away. And the apartment, really cool decor, comfy bed, and everything you could possible need. To top it all off, Jonathan was quick to respond to any questions and amazing to deal with. Definitely check this place out if you need somewhere to stay in Calgary!",
      "We spent almost two weeks at Jonathan\u2019s apartment in Calgary and we enjoyed our stay. The photos completely coincide with the space. It is very comfortable for two people. We enjoyed the city view, well equipped kitchen and cozy sofa and bed. The apartment desk is very useful if you are thinking of working remotely. In top of all that Jhonatan is a very attentive and ready to give you support.",
      "Jonathan is a fantastic host.  Can\u2019t do better.  Place is spotless, beautiful views and just that \u2018home away from home\u2019 feel.<br/>Bed & bedding top notch -  slept like a baby.  Can still hear the trains, but didn\u2019t  wake me at night and for the location, it\u2019s hard to avoid this, it\u2019s high enough that it\u2019s not a bother.  Perfectly equipped.

Having secure convenient underground parking made everything so easy.<br/>The condo itself is beautifully appointed with everything you could possibly need. It was spotlessly clean, with crisp white towels and linens that made it feel like a luxury hotel. It\u2019s the perfect space for up to two people.<br/>The building amenities are great,the pool may be on the smaller side, but it was more than sufficient for a refreshing dip. What really stood out were the thoughtful little touches Jonathan put into the space. His collection of retro cassette tapes and the ghetto blaster added such a fun, personal vibe and put a smile on my face throughout my stay.<br/>Overall, a fantastic experience,I\u2019d definitely recommend this condo to anyone looking for comfort, convenience, and character.",

We enjoyed the city view, well equipped kitchen and cozy sofa and bed. The apartment desk is very useful if you are thinking of working remotely. In top of all that Jhonatan is a very attentive and ready to give you support.",

      "We had a wonderful stay at Anna\u2019s place!! The apartment was just as pictured with gorgeous views. The location was absolutely perfect and walking distance to everywhere we needed to go. Anna was a wonderful and very responsive host and made the check in/check out process super smooth for us. Would definitely stay here again!",
      "I recommend the Anna\u2019s place.  Nice location, nice view and clean unit.  And had everything I needed in the unit.  The communication was excellent.  I would stay here again.",
      "This was the perfect place for my short time in Calgary. Central and nice area to walk around also. <br/>The apartment has great views and the host was responsive and helpful. <br/>Would definitely book it again.",
      "I can't wait to stay here again! I loved the location: walkable, restaurants galore, best bars, etc...I felt safe and people were really friendly. The space was beautiful and had everything I needed - including Nespresso coffee. The views were spectacular; I enjoyed waking up to the sunrise from the bed. This place invigorated me in so many ways! <br/>Anna was extremely responsive and her communication truly showed how much she cares for her guests. Highly recommend!",
      "I stayed for two weeks with my teenage son. Thanks to Anna, we were able to enjoy a safe and comfortable environment, along with a room that offered a wonderful view. It was truly an unforgettable experience in my life.<br/>The location is close to downtown, and there are two supermarkets nearby, which made cooking very convenient. A sofa bed was also provided, making the room spacious and comfortable.<br/>I highly recommend this place, especially for parents traveling with their children:)",
      "This was a perfect condo for my trip. The location is prime, the condo is spacious, well equipped and very modern, and the host is very nice and helpful. Very suitable for both short and longer term stays in Calgary.",
      "You just can\u2019t beat the location and the views. The place had everything we needed and the bed was comfy. We were there for 2 nights and slept great! Nice work station too.",
      "Anna\u2019s condo was great.  Loved the location which was walkable to many restaurants and shops in the heart of the city.  It was nice not having to worry about parking being so close to everything.",
      "Great place to stay! Clean, easy check-in/out, convenient location in city, quiet building, loved the corner unit. No issues at all, Anna was a great host, would highly recommend to others!",
      "Great location with much walkable food and amenities near by. Amazing view of the city and skyline of the mountains on the horizon. The full Calgary experience.",
      "Great place to spend a few nights in Calgary. Near great restaurants and coffee shops. Very walkable. Clean and cozy.",
      "Anna\u2019s beautiful place was perfect for our stay in Calgary!  An easy walk to and from BMO Center/Saddledome/Stampede grounds.  The bedroom doors close so a second person can stay up later and watch TV in the living room which has a good sofa bed.  A walk-in shower and a bath/shower combo were a bonus. Great closet space and laundry.  All the apartment features made for a comfortable and wonderful multi-day stay.  Anna is the BEST kind of host\u2026communicates clearly, responds quickly.  She answered my many questions about the neighborhood which as a first-timer to that part of Canada, I GREATLY appreciated!   I highly recommend this place!",
      "Anna was a great host.  Her place was as described and was everything I expected.  Her place is in a great neighbour and very close to everything downtown.  The only draw back to the building is having to use the fob to exit the parkade, finding a place to park on the street, and then returning the fob to the unit.",
      "Anna\u2019s place was exactly as described. We will definitely return. Highly recommend.",
      "Great space to stay for a quick trip.  Anna was extremely responsive to all questions.",
      "We loved our stay at Anna\u2019s apartment, it was comfortable, clean and had everything we needed there. Location was perfect too. Would definitely stay there again!",
      "Can't say enough about this place - bed was firm and super supportive and comfortable - couldn't even feel my partner who typically tosses all night.  The water pressure was a pleasant surprise - very powerful!  room darkening blinds really help because this unit has windows on 2 sides, which gives a very open roominess feel.  The location was perfect as our son was competing at the nearby MNP sport complex, less than a 10 min walk away and the unit was so close to 17th avenue where there is incredible nightlife and energy.  <br/>Anna was extremely pro-active on the happenings of the condo complex and an excellent communicator with great recommendations.  Typically responded to text messages in less than 2 minutes.  It felt like we were her top priority.  The Nespresso machine and pods was also a nice touch as were the granola bars and microwave popcorn (which we took advantage of having arrived at 10pm).  Great place - we will come back for sure!!",
      "we stumbled across Anna's rental when our original rental had some plumbing issues they couldn't fix immediately. The unit is in a great location, and Anna was very accommodating with it being a last minute booking. we will definitely be back as this place has a great vibe to it.",
      "Very clean centrally located.  Lovely views.  Easy walking distance to restaurants and shopping.  Very clear instructions how to get in and leave.  Host was available and responded immediately to any questions we asked. The unit was pristine and had everything available to make our stay enjoyable.  We highly recommend this unit and we would love to stay there again if/and when we might visit Calgary in the future.  Thank you for making our Christmas memorable.<br/>Lila & Ron Tucker",

The water pressure was a pleasant surprise - very powerful!  room darkening blinds really help because this unit has windows on 2 sides, which gives a very open roominess feel.  The location was perfect as our son was competing at the nearby MNP sport complex, less than a 10 min walk away and the unit was so close to 17th avenue where there is incredible nightlife and energy.  <br/>Anna was extremely pro-active on the happenings of the condo complex and an excellent communicator with great recommendations.  Typically responded to text messages in less than 2 minutes.  It felt like we were her top priority.  The Nespresso machine and pods was also a nice touch as were the granola bars and microwave popcorn (which we took advantage of having arrived at 10pm).  Great place - we will come back for sure!!",

      "Location was super for walking to C-train to get to Stampede grounds.  Many great restaurants right around the corner on 4th, plus a Shoppers and Safeway nearby, which was a nice surprise and very handy.  It is a basement suite, so more of a sleep and go location, though the kitchen is well equipped if you want to do any meals.  John was easy to reach, welcoming, and responded quickly.   I would stay again \ud83d\ude0a",
      "John\u2019s Airbnb was absolutely perfect! We stayed for four months without a single issue, and it truly felt like home. The location is amazing\u2014very walkable, close to the river, and surrounded by beautiful parks with plenty to do. The place is well-equipped with everything we needed for a long stay, and it was also great for our pet. John was a fantastic host\u2014friendly, responsive, and always helpful. We absolutely loved our time here and would recommend it to anyone!",
      "Perfect location for lots of dining options",
      "We booked John's place as a base for our move to Canada, and it was a lovely place to land when we got to the country. Very spacious and with good amounts of kitchen and bathroom space. The immediate area was pretty quiet which was a nice aspect, and it was super close to drugstores, groceries and lots of restaurants and coffee shops to explore. Easy to walk to downtown or catch a C-Train in, it's a great spot for exploring Calgary. John was one of the most responsive hosts I've ever stayed with and I really appreciated how quickly he got back to me and so quickly. Very considerate when our plans changed, which I'm very grateful for \ud83d\ude0a",
      "Solid stay! Great location and responsive host!",
      "The accommodation is so neat and there are plenty of necessities! I love the location.",
      "Stayed here for a weekend for the Calgary Stampede. Was only a 20 minute walk from the grounds, close to so many restaurants, quiet at night and parking was included. Looked exactly like the photos and the bedroom and bathroom were very spacious. Will definitely stay here again next time I\u2019m in Calgary.",
      "Myself, my husband and our gorgeous dog moved over here from the UK and found John's place and thought it would keep us afloat for about 5 weeks. We absolutely loved this amazing place. We felt right at home right away, the location is perfect and John is such a perfect host. Nothing was too much trouble. Can't recommend this place enough!",
      "Had a great stay. Suite looks like pictures. John was very responsive and attentive to a few minor issues that came up. The location was wonderful -easy walking distance to anything you may need or want. Three blocks east on 25 Ave is a lovely walking path along the river - walk for as long as you want. Will take you to the Calgary Stampede grounds in 20 minutes. <br/>Would stay here again!",
      "Great location. I stayed for 1 month, so my needs are a bit different than a brief stay but overall, my needs were met. <br/>I gave a 3 on overall experience because the mattress is ready for the trash and I didn\u2019t sleep well the entire time. Once the mattress is replaced, its value will go up but if you want good sleep, until the caved in mattress is replaced, it might be hard. <br/>Other than that, John was communicative and helpful. You\u2019ll be able to cook a meal, and do laundry. Master shower is awkward and needs a no slip mat but no real complaints on basic needs.",
      "Excellent place to get to know the center of Calgary, very well equipped and quiet, a very family-friendly area but also with many restaurants and markets nearby.",
      "We had a great stay at John's apartment. Highly recommended! The apartment is located in Mission which is a great area with small boutiques, fine dining and walking distance to Stampede Park. The street parking is easy and always as space. Communication and check-in very easy.",
      "John is a great host. He is very helpful and accommodating. Very quick response times and was always there if I needed anything. It was great that I was able to bring my two cats with me. The area is great and there is lots to do! Thanks John",
      "We enjoyed it so much!",
      "John is a great host. He is very responsive and will help out right away if there is an issue. Thank you so much, John!",

      "A gorgeous suite in an excellent location with lots to do in the immediate area (many restaurants, pubs and bars). John is a great host, responds to questions quickly and made the stay seamless. Highly recommend for anyone looking for a place to stay in Calgary.",

      "Amazing location. Communication was great. Super easy check-in. Comfortable and clean apartment with everything you need to feel at home. Would definitely recommend.",

Very spacious and with good amounts of kitchen and bathroom space. The immediate area was pretty quiet which was a nice aspect, and it was super close to drugstores, groceries and lots of restaurants and coffee shops to explore. Easy to walk to downtown or catch a C-Train in, it's a great spot for exploring Calgary. John was one of the most responsive hosts I've ever stayed with and I really appreciated how quickly he got back to me and so quickly. Very considerate when our plans changed, which I'm very grateful for \ud83d\ude0a",

I stayed for 1 month, so my needs are a bit different than a brief stay but overall, my needs were met. <br/>I gave a 3 on overall experience because the mattress is ready for the trash and I didn\u2019t sleep well the entire time. Once the mattress is replaced, its value will go up but if you want good sleep, until the caved in mattress is replaced, it might be hard. <br/>Other than that, John was communicative and helpful. You\u2019ll be able to cook a meal, and do laundry. Master shower is awkward and needs a no slip mat but no real complaints on basic needs.",

Review for future guests who may be affected by trip cancellations outside their control.",

The place itself was clean, comfortable, and had all the necessary amenities to make the stay convenient and hassle-free. On-site parking and gym access were added bonuses that made things even better. Communication with the hosts was smooth and prompt\u2014they were helpful and responsive throughout. Overall, a very pleasant experience and I\u2019d happily stay here again on my next visit to Calgary. Highly recommended!",

The views were absolutely beautiful, and it\u2019s clear the hosts put a lot of care into every detail. The kitchen was well-stocked, making it easy to cook and relax during our stay. Overall, a really lovely and thoughtfully designed place. We\u2019d definitely stay here again!",
      "\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f Amazing Stay with a Stunning Downtown View!<br/>I absolutely loved my stay at this Airbnb! The highlight was definitely the breathtaking downtown Calgary view \u2014 it was beautiful both day and night. The apartment was spotless, modern, and had everything I needed for a comfortable stay. The host was friendly, responsive, and made check-in super easy. The location couldn\u2019t be better \u2014 right in the heart of the city",
      "This place was such a lucky find! It was so beautiful! Karly had lots of nice little touches that made the place feel luxurious and comfortable. She was very responsive and checked in on us throughout our stay. The view alone was worth the money, beautiful views of the sunset from up on the 17th floor! Loved our stay and hope to be back in the future.",
      "What a view!   Beautiful condo with amazing views.  Comfortable king bed and fully stocked kitchen.  Was great to have the underground parking stall.  Thanks for a wonderful stay.",
      "I booked a different unit for an employee who was visiting town, when I found out a couple of hours before check in that the unit was no longer available. In a pinch, I booked this unit. Karly was absolutely wonderful! She was super helpful and responded to my messages promptly. She was also able to accommodate an early check in as our employee had already arrived to town and the unit was available. The unit itself was absolutely beautiful, and very clean. The pictures portray it perfectly! Our employee was very happy with this place. Highly recommended and look forward to booking here again!! Thanks Karly and Kelly!",
      "Great place. Clean, great views and overall just a stunning place. Loved everything about it",
      "Favorite place in Calgary by a far! Reasonably priced, fantastic location and an exceptional host. Thank you.",
      "We had such a wonderful stay! Karly was incredibly accommodating and communicative from start to finish, which made everything so easy. The little extras she provided were such a thoughtful touch - from the bath salts to the black makeup-removal towel (so much better than white facecloths!) to the cozy Fairmont robes. The kitchen was stocked with everything we could possibly need, and the included parking was the clincher for us.<br/>Although we were only in town for one night, we truly wished we could have stayed longer. The location is unbeatable - having lived in Calgary for three years, I can say this is the best area for restaurants, coffee shops, brewpubs, and easy access to downtown and the convention centre.<br/>We\u2019d absolutely stay again and recommend Karly\u2019s place to anyone visiting Calgary!",

The little extras she provided were such a thoughtful touch - from the bath salts to the black makeup-removal towel (so much better than white facecloths!) to the cozy Fairmont robes. The kitchen was stocked with everything we could possibly need, and the included parking was the clincher for us.<br/>Although we were only in town for one night, we truly wished we could have stayed longer. The location is unbeatable - having lived in Calgary for three years, I can say this is the best area for restaurants, coffee shops, brewpubs, and easy access to downtown and the convention centre.<br/>We\u2019d absolutely stay again and recommend Karly\u2019s place to anyone visiting Calgary!",

      "Our family of four stayed for three nights. The apartment looked a little tired in person, but functionally everything was available as advertised. Beth's team were exceptionally proactive and provided great detail, and the views were to die for, particularly at sunrise. The beds were a little firm for our liking, but might suit others - thanks for having us.",
      "I spent four days at Beth's apartment  downtown Calgary, and it was an amazing experience. The sunrises over the downtown skyline were absolutely beautiful. There are also plenty of restaurants and a vibrant nightlife, making it a great place for anyone wanting to get to know the heart of Calgary. I absolutely loved it!\u2763\ufe0f",
      "This was by far one of the best stays I\u2019ve had dt Calgary. The customer service alone was so reliable and easy flowing. Beth made sure I was comfortable and answered all my questions. The unit was lovely very relaxing ambiance and great amenities within the building. The check in was smooth and straight forward as well as check out. I absolutely plan on rebooking this in the future so don\u2019t walk run to book before it\u2019s gone!",
      "Beth and her team took great care of us from start to finish. Property felt very spacious with high, concrete ceilings, large windows, beautiful corner views (looking out to the Calgary tower from master bedroom), and spotless. Excellent location - very walkable to all sites and restaurants, including walks at the Bow River. Perfect for our 2 night stay, prior to flying out. A1 - highly recommend to all. <br/>Cheers!<br/>Marie",
      "Enjoyed our stay as the place was very clean and had everything we needed. The host had very clear instructions and was quick and easy to communicate with. We did not notice the apartment was right next to multiple train tracks when we booked (our own fault), just be of caution if your a light sleeper that the trains run all night and can be loud (as well as many sirens). Great location though for night life as you can walk to many restaurants/ bars and shops around. <br/>Thanks for having us!",
      "Bright, clean, nice apartment ! Apartment managed by a company - professionally handled. Neighbourhood is good location for access to downtown and lots of nice restaurants  ; however it also carries with it a significant amount of displaced individuals (homeless/ substance abusers etc ) outside hanging around. They all seemed to be mostly harmless but good to be aware. Overall is a good apartment and place to stay especially as a home base for exploring Calgary .",
      "Location was perfect! Very close to all the attractions, very walkable. Place was clean and equipped with coffee and cooking ingredients like oil and seasonings. Building is very safe. Detailed instructions are provided. <br/>Best of all, Beth was extremely responsive. We locked ourselves out early morning on our last day and she responded quickly so we didn\u2019t miss our flights. My advice is to read the manual and instructions so you don\u2019t get locked out. \ud83d\ude09",
      "Pros: Beautiful clean condo with small but nice patio. Great location. Amenities in kitchen and bathroom. Sheets/pillows/blankets for pullout. Blackout curtains on bedroom windows. Responsive (if sometimes unhelpful) host. <br/>Cons: Check in was late in the day and inflexible. En suite bath is severely clogged. Only two elevators made it challenging at times. Only one building key fob. Train tracks across the street with late night trains. Bedroom doors are frosted which lets in light (not a huge deal).",
      "We  really enjoyed our \"home\" in the sky. It is a beautiful apartment with tasteful design and elegant touches.  Comfy seating with huge windows. Upscale amenities and appliances throughout. Spotlessly clean. The roomy balcony had comfy seating from which we watched perfect sunsets behind the Olympic ski jump in the distance. A lightbulb burned out during our stay and it was replaced promptly.  Management was kind and helpful. Highly recommend. <br/>Thank you!",
      "My family of three had a wonderful time. The panoramic city views, visible from every room, were absolutely captivating and made every moment feel luxurious. Beth was a great host, very friendly and responsive. Communication was effortless and immediate, from the initial booking to any questions that arose during our stay. The condo is in a central location yet very quiet at night. This is definitely a place we'll be recommending and returning to!",
      "Beautiful place, very quiet and private. Great view of the city and super clean as well as organized. Very clear easy step by step instructions for everything. This allowed us to enjoy our trip with no hold ups from having to message the host for instructions on anything.",
      "The perfect apartment for our family of 5 adults in a great location with absolutely everything we needed for our entire stay. Spacious and clean with tasteful decor throughout, every appliance needed was provided and very comfortable beds. <br/>The management team were super responsive and extremely helpful throughout the booking and stay. Great downtown location with great bars and restaurants nearby and fantastic dual aspect views of the city and beyond.<br/>We will definitely stay here again on our next trip to wonderful Calgary. Thank you Beth and team \ud83e\udd17",
      "Beautiful location and condo which met our needs adequately!  Management team was excellent with prompt responses, simplified instructions, and fabulous restaurant recommendations that were literally right around the corner!  Such a wonderful trip!",
      "The air bnb was clean, in a perfect location and easy to access. The host was very responsive! Lots of instructions but if you read them carefully you have all the information you need.",
      "Perfect location for exploring downtown Calgary and convenient access to all levels of shopping and restaurants.  The unit is super cute and comfortable with comfy beds and pillows!  The host is extremely responsive and accommodating, and provides clear and thorough instructions along with great resources for the area.  The building is quiet, and we heard no noise at night.  Highly recommend the Last Best Brewing and Distilling, which is a 2-minute walk away, great happy hour and food.",
      "I spent my last week in Calgary here. I had neck & hand injuries, so my perspective is a bit different. The 22nd floor view is nice. I kept the windows uncovered 24/7. I loved the sun waking me up naturally. The kitchen is well-equipped. Checking in & out is easy. The bathtubs are long & deep. Very hot water. There are plenty of restaurants nearby w/delivery. The waste chute is a few steps from the door. Safeway is a 7 minute walk away. Those are the positives.<br/>Worst ever pillows. I can't even guess what they're filled with. Nothing? The extra pillows in the closet were hard as a rock. For someone w/neck issues like me, it was excruciating.<br/>Bring your own coffee unless you like deep discount brands or decaf. Mgmt never swapped out the Zenius decaf for me like they said they would. <br/>No facial tissues, a miscalibrated thermostat, and a troublesome front door lock (code had to be entered twice every time) were other issues. <br/>I won't stay anywhere managed by this company again.",
      "The host was responsive and kind, and the place was beautiful -just as pictured & described!",
      "I visited Calgary for the first time with my family, and it was a wonderful experience with Beth from Key Rental Management. Check-in and check-out were smooth and effortless.<br/>The space itself was immaculate, secure, and thoughtfully equipped. We loved having clear instructions, which we truly appreciated from Beth. Whenever we needed something, they responded promptly\u2014within just a few minutes\u2014without any delay.<br/>The condo was exactly as pictured: spotless, beautifully styled, and incredibly cozy. This rustic Japandi-inspired condo is situated in the heart of downtown\u2014close to great restaurants and vibrant nightlife. The rustic Japandi vibe gave the place a warm, modern feel.<br/>Communication was quick and reliable, and everything felt secure and spotless.<br/>Thank you so much, Beth, for providing such a wonderful experience at your place. It was truly memorable, and we will definitely consider staying at the Rustic Japandi-Inspired condo again for future visits to Calgary.",
      "This was my first Air BNB reservation, and Beth made it feel very smooth. Great location and great walkable resturant in this area.",
      "We really enjoyed our stay in Calgary. The apartment was clean and exactly what we wanted.",
      "Beth\u2019s communication was outstanding! The instructions to get into the bnb was also very easy to understand. \ud83d\ude0a",
      "Clean apartment and great views. Very clear instructions from host. Would recommend staying here!",
      "The stay was awesome!  We always had a response from the host to help us with anything we needed!! The location was awesome with an amazing view!!",
      "If you want to stay in downtown Calgary, there\u2019s probably no better place to stay. Awesome location, and the place was great."

I loved the sun waking me up naturally. The kitchen is well-equipped. Checking in & out is easy. The bathtubs are long & deep. Very hot water. There are plenty of restaurants nearby w/delivery. The waste chute is a few steps from the door. Safeway is a 7 minute walk away. Those are the positives.<br/>Worst ever pillows. I can't even guess what they're filled with. Nothing? The extra pillows in the closet were hard as a rock. For someone w/neck issues like me, it was excruciating.<br/>Bring your own coffee unless you like deep discount brands or decaf. Mgmt never swapped out the Zenius decaf for me like they said they would. <br/>No facial tissues, a miscalibrated thermostat, and a troublesome front door lock (code had to be entered twice every time) were other issues. <br/>I won't stay anywhere managed by this company again.",

I used to live in Calgary for four years but definitely feel like I missed so much of the city after staying at Mo\u2019s. We had a clear view of the stunning sunset in the evening from the patio as well as the pink glow of dawn alongside the Calgary Tower in the morning. Pure magic! Would 100% stay here again!",
      "Great place to stay! Right downtown so amazing location. The host was very responsive to any questions I had. Nice and clean place with a comfortable bed! Would stay here again. Thank you!",

      "We had a perfect stay at Kyle\u2019s! The flat was very clean and in great condition. We always had a sunset view from the balcony. The communication with the host was also a 10/10 - very clear instructions and good communication. We felt very safe and comfortable. We would definitely book a stay at Kyle\u2019s again!",
      "Excellent communication from the beginning and was blown away when we walked into the apartment. The views across the city are outstanding and it's in a great central location. There is private secure parking and the apartment had everything we needed and was spotless. Would definintely book here again when we return to Calgary.",
      "This place has immaculate views, great location, and has lots of amenities like parking! Hosts were great about communicating and explaining everything! Highly recommend if you are in the area!",
      "Loved this place! It was spotless, in a fantastic location close to great restaurants and shopping, and the bed was super comfy. Communication was top-notch\u2014responses came within minutes every time. I travel to Calgary regularly, and this is now my first choice!",
      "I really enjoyed my stay! The hosts communicated clearly and made everything easy. The location was perfect for our mini getaway \u2014 everything we needed was nearby. And the views were definitely a highlight!",
      "We had so much fun staying on the 20th floor and overlooking Calgary. The patio was fabulous and huge windows made the views even more stunning! <br/>The noise of city life happening around us was audible from our room but didn\u2019t disturb us as it was a constant drone of noise. <br/>The sun woke us up in the morning and was a welcome awakening! <br/>*please note, if you are a light sleeper or light sensitive, I would suggest bringing any necessary amenities to account for this.",
      "The apartment is close to the centre of Calgary, just a 10 min walk, which was great. Things we would have liked to know beforehand were as follows:<br/>1. It\u2019s close to a freight railway, which is quite noisy through the night.<br/>2. The blinds are not blackout and let in a lot of light at night time. <br/>3. On multiple occasions on entering the building there were many homeless/addicts hanging around, which was confronting as we aren\u2019t used to that. <br/>4. It is a bit of a faff to get in first time, you find and pay for street parking, and the touch pad to get in isn\u2019t sensitive so it took some firm pressure to get it to respond - we thought we were doing it wrong! <br/>These are mostly outside of the control of the hosts, and due to the location of the building. <br/>The hairdryer is tiny and low powered so if you\u2019re like me with hair of a winter bison, take your own as the one supplied won\u2019t get the job done efficiently. <br/>The hosts were great  in their communication and were keen to resolve issues.",
      "10/10 recommend the stay! We loved the city views and vibes from the balcony! Coming back for sure:)",
      "We really enjoyed our stay here! Kyle was wonderful to chat with, very responsive and the instructions for everything were super easy and seamless to follow. <br/>You are definitely in the heart of downtown here, and are engulfed by the sounds and sights! The views are stunning, and the floor to ceiling windows allowed for lots of beautiful natural light. <br/>We loved that we were walking distance to so many great restaurants, bars, grocery stores etc. Sadly, there are lots of homeless and people asking for money in the area, but they aren\u2019t bothersome or causing trouble. <br/>Will definitely stay again!",
      "Everything is super well organised! The instructions are super detailed and easy and quick reaction from both guys! Will definitely come back and do recommend the place! The only downside was that during my stay there was only one functioning elevator, so had to wait a bit to go up to 20 or to come down, but the guys had nothing to do with it! Highly recommended!",
      "Kyle and Andrew were exceptional hosts! They were super helpful and let us know that they were always available if we had any questions or concerns. Their unit was extremely clean and was at a great location, as everything was of walking distance. I definitely recommend this airbnb if anyone is looking to visit downtown Calgary!",
      "Great place to stay ! Comfy bed , wonderful location and hosts! Will be back !",
      "Wow what a view! <br/>The view is fantastic, sunset is just breathtaking:) first night we were tired after long hours of driving and we stayed in- didn\u2019t regret as we got to enjoy stunning sunset! <br/>It was way to find the place, check in quite easy. The apartment is very pretty, nicely decorated, the instructions clear. Everything spotless clean. <br/>There\u2019s secured parking which is a huge advantage. Everything is walking distance. I was so pleased to discover fantastic vegan restaurant just downstairs. It doesn\u2019t happen often :) <br/>Kyle and Andrew messaged us during our stay making sure everything was ok and replied to my messages quite quickly. Just too bad we didn\u2019t get to meet them in person, I\u2019m sure they are lovely people. <br/>We are on our 3 week US- Canada roadtrip, you can imagine we slept in different places. This was our favorite so far! <br/>Thank you guys",
      "A fantastic apartment in the heart of Calgary with views of the Rocky Mountains from your window in the morning to the Calgary skyline lights in the evening. The views on their own are worth the money!<br/>The place is clean and real homely feel. We would 100% stay again when we return to Calgary",
      "This location was perfect and walking distance to downtown. Kyle was very communicative and quickly responded to my messages. Place was clean, shower pressure was strong, and the suite was well taken cared of. Highly recommend this home to others visiting Calgary.",
      "Loved staying at Kyle & Andrew\u2019s place. Perfect location downtown and a spacious 1 bedroom apartment that fit two of us comfortably. Would definitely stay again when I\u2019m back in Calgary!",
      "A modern bright apartment with outstanding views over Calgary towards the Rockies.",
      "The location and view of the accommodation were fantastic. Even though it was downtown, you could see all the way to Seolsan, and even though you could hear a little bit of the city noise, it was perfect for enjoying downtown.<br/>I was a little embarrassed that the check-in process didn't go smoothly as instructed, and I spent a lot of time using the kitchen appliances because they didn't work well, but overall, I think it was a good experience. If you're staying in Calgary, I would definitely recommend it.",
      "Perfect location, friendly host, and easy instructions.",
      "Great location, clean and spacious. Wonderful hosts!",
      "This is definitely a place you must visit. The host was wonderful and the pictures is one thing but seeing it in person is another feeling. Definitely 10/10",
      "Kyle\u2019s place was just as described, the view of the mountains was an added plus! We would definitely recommend this place to anyone staying in Calgary!",
      "Place was amazing with great views of the city. Kyle was really<br/>Responsive to my texts as well! Great host and would highly recommend",
      "The place is clean, but don\u2019t expect thoughtful responses on your questions about the property from owners."

        "review": "The apartment is close to the centre of Calgary, just a 10 min walk, which was great. Things we would have liked to know beforehand were as follows:<br/>1. It\u2019s close to a freight railway, which is quite noisy through the night.<br/>2. The blinds are not blackout and let in a lot of light at night time. <br/>3. On multiple occasions on entering the building there were many homeless/addicts hanging around, which was confronting as we aren\u2019t used to that. <br/>4. It is a bit of a faff to get in first time, you find and pay for street parking, and the touch pad to get in isn\u2019t sensitive so it took some firm pressure to get it to respond - we thought we were doing it wrong! <br/>These are mostly outside of the control of the hosts, and due to the location of the building. <br/>The hairdryer is tiny and low powered so if you\u2019re like me with hair of a winter bison, take your own as the one supplied won\u2019t get the job done efficiently. <br/>The hosts were great  in their communication and were keen to resolve issues.",

The views are stunning, and the floor to ceiling windows allowed for lots of beautiful natural light. <br/>We loved that we were walking distance to so many great restaurants, bars, grocery stores etc. Sadly, there are lots of homeless and people asking for money in the area, but they aren\u2019t bothersome or causing trouble. <br/>Will definitely stay again!",

The apartment is very pretty, nicely decorated, the instructions clear. Everything spotless clean. <br/>There\u2019s secured parking which is a huge advantage. Everything is walking distance. I was so pleased to discover fantastic vegan restaurant just downstairs. It doesn\u2019t happen often :) <br/>Kyle and Andrew messaged us during our stay making sure everything was ok and replied to my messages quite quickly. Just too bad we didn\u2019t get to meet them in person, I\u2019m sure they are lovely people. <br/>We are on our 3 week US- Canada roadtrip, you can imagine we slept in different places.

      "It\u2019s that luxurious feeling the moment you step inside ..the furniture is beautifully balanced ..I kicked off my shoes and sank into the couch ,gazing out the windows at the sparkling city lights and towering buildings truly a captivating view at night \u2026the host was incredibly kind and responsive making the stay more enjoyable",
      "This unit was very clean. The beds were extremely comfortable with nice linens. Check in was easy and the underground parking fit our full size truck. Hosts were communicative and helpful.  <br/>We were there for a wedding, so can't speak to the neighborhood per se, but cute restaurants and shopping easily accessible by foot.<br/>Would stay again next time in the area.",
      "Beth's place was as advertised!  we loved how spotless and clean everything felt.  usually when we stay at other Airbnb's when we wear our slippers inside the house you can see the dirt and grime on the soles however it was hardly noticable with Beth's place.  we appreciate how clean it was.<br/>I'd definitely stay here again.",
      "I cannot say enough good things about our stay at Beth's place in downtown Calgary-the location, the indoor condo space, the appointments, the view, the communication....fabulous in every way. Truly a wonderful experience. Thank you, Beth and your team! If and when we get back to Calgary I will definitely book with Beth.",
      "This was a real gem! Great spot in the downtown area and beautiful night time view. The place itself was spotless - super clean, thoughtful amenities (k-cups were a lifesaver in the morning), and modern sleek furnishing. I\u2019d definitely stay here again when  in Calgary!",
      "Great location, near restaurants and pubs. Short walk to Saddledome for our concert. Decorated well, nice looking place. Gets warm in the unit at night even after turning temp down in advance. Beds are closer to doubles than queens. <br/>Overall was great and would stay here again!",
      "I loved staying in this apartment. It was exactly as described. The view, the location, the apartment itself. It was all amazing. We stayed in the city and driving to Banff for Lake Louise and Morraine lake was 2 hours, but well worth it.  The instructions were very clear and their response times were very quick. Food in the area was amazing. It's fairly quiet, especially on weekdays. We've been to Montreal and Quebec and so far Alberta and its residents were the nicest and most welcoming Canadians we've encountered. I would highly recommend this place and would definitely stay here again.",
      "A very professionally run unit with a responsive host and dedicated property manager. Unit was in excellent shape and it is across the street from perhaps the best stretch of restaurants in the entire city. We'll definitely stay here again the next time we visit.",
      "I had such a wonderful stay! The host was incredibly welcoming, responsive, and made everything so easy from check-in to check-out. They went above and beyond to make sure I was comfortable and even arranged a late checkout, which was a huge help.<br/>The location was perfect \u2014 safe, quiet, and close to everything I needed. The space was exactly as described (if not better!) \u2014 clean, cozy, and well-equipped with all the little touches that make you feel at home.<br/>I would absolutely recommend this place to anyone visiting the area and will be happy to stay here again on my next trip.",
      "I had such a great stay here. First off the unit was spacious, clean, and had the most comfortable bed I\u2019d ever slept in.<br/>The views were stunning, so nice to have views of the city.<br/>It was right across the street from so many great eating options, one being First St. Market - which had a variety of high scale vendors in which I ate most my meals.<br/>I will definitely recommend and will be back! Thanks team!",
      "Beth and her team were great! Very responsive and polite. The unit was clean bright and spacious for our family of four. The location was great, lots of restaurant options and easy access to all of Calgary. I would definitely stay here again!",
      "Beautiful place. My 18 yr old son thought the couch was very comfy. No blinds in living area so if you mind bright, early in the am and are sleeping on the couch, bring an eye mask. Bedrooms were great. Kitchen had lots of items to cook pretty much anything. Instructions for checking-in were easy to follow but the only issue we had is we were given wrong keys causing us to have to carry our luggage up and down stairs until we got the correct keys. \ud83d\ude15",
      "The location was great! The views were great! The unit was not ready at checkin time, and we got to spend 1.5 hours with the cleaner which lead to a very strained communication in texts and over the phone with the host.  Attention to cleaning the windows, furniture, and the oven would be suggested.",
      "Amazing place extremely clean. The only complaint I have is that no towels were provided but other than that I had an amazing stay.",
      "This was a great place to stay with amazing views. The host was very kind and helpful. Thank you for making our trip so enjoyable!",
      "Beautiful condo with amazing city views. Loved that is was within walking distance to restaurants and shopping. Great stay!",

      "A lovely basement suite will all the amenities you would need including a full kitchen. Steps from restaurants, bars and coffee shops. Steps from the Elbow River with its wonderful walking/bicycling trails. Courtney was very responsive and instructions were clean and concise. I will definitely visit again.",
      "My flight got canceled due to the Air Canada strike, so I had to book this Airbnb very last minute. Courtney was such a great host\u2014she even let me check in earlier than the regular time, which was a huge help. The place itself is really nice, and we enjoyed walking through downtown from here. If we ever come back, we\u2019d definitely love to stay here again!",
      "Courtney was incredibly accommodating and helpful! I had to book a place to stay rather last minute, and she was kind enough to let me switch units after the first night due to mixed availability and store my luggage while the new unit was being cleaned in between guests - a real lifesaver! The units themselves were beautiful & cozy, with plenty of amenities and a perfect location. I would definitely stay here again the next time I'm in Calgary - highly recommend!",
      "This place is one of my favorite Airbnbs I\u2019ve stayed at in Calgary! I come back often to visit family. This place feels like a home, and doesn\u2019t have the stale creepy beige decor that I\u2019m used to seeing in Airbnbs. Instead it\u2019s very warm while also being clean and tasteful. The layout is great, it\u2019s roomy and the perfect size for one person or a couple. The amazing neighborhood and access to amenities, cafes, river walking trails, and restaurants CANNOT be surpassed! I really appreciated the fully stocked kitchen, large closet, and really nice toiletries.",
      "The location is perfect, walkable to grocery store, restaurants and coffee shops. The accommodation was exactly what the pictures showed, clean and comfortable. Courtney was quick to respond to our questions. I would definitely stay again and recommend to friends.",
      "Courtneys place was lovely & comfortable for 2 of us. Location was great for getting to the Stampede with lots of cafes and restaurants close by. The apartment has everything you need and feels like a home from home. The bed is one of the most comfortable we've ever slept in! The coffee gift cards were a lovely touch. Highly recommend this place to everyone!",
      "Amazing place in Calgary! <br/>Courtney is amazing, helped and answered all what we needed, and always so polite . <br/>The location is superb - 3 min walk from  the downtown , but quiet and peaceful. <br/>The apartment is clean and beautiful, having all what you need for a pleasant stay. <br/>We will come back next time in Calgary - no doubt about that.",
      "If you are visiting Calgary, this is the place to stay. The corner property is a lovely well landscaped yard with a courtyard perfect for a sunset glass of wine. The historic apartment is gorgeous, clean and well laid out. We felt right at home!  Courtney also gave me a great list of local restaurants, coffee shops and grocery stores all within walking distance. Overall a 10 star experience!",
      "Great setting, private and perfect location. It was so easy to be in contact with Courtney. As this was my first time staying in a Airbnb, Courtney answered all my many questions and made it a great experience! <br/>I  highly recommend that you stay in this lovely suite!",
      "This was the perfect place to stay close to downtown, but also steps away from trail running, MNP sports center, and Mount Royal. The suite was comfortable, well appointed and a delight to stay in. I would definitely recommend.",
      "Courtney\u2019s place was amazing and stylish. I had a wonderful stay and everything was super clean and felt like home. The neighbourhood was gorgeous and walkable with great eats. Highly recommend!",
      "We were blown away by the kindness of Courtney and how she bent over backwards to accommodate us. After a not-so-nice stay at a different Airbnb that we were forced to end early, Courtney absolutely saved the day by allowing us to check in early and treating us so nicely when I had particular requirements related to needing to have no scent/chemicals used on my linen. She never made me feel like a burden or that it was too much to ask. Every interaction was speedy, friendly and she provided ample detail on her instructions. <br/>As for the apartment- WOW. Styled to perfection. The surrounding area was lovely to walk around with lots of amenities nearby and beautiful to look at. The bed is supportive and on the firmer side. Plenty of storage/cupboard space. It had everything we needed. Could easily have stayed here for months! We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would 10/10 stay again. Courtney- you are an amazing host! THANK YOU ever so kindly \ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffc",
      "We had a wonderful stay at this beautiful, professionally designed suite. All the details that make for a special stay were included: a comfy bed and quality linens,  extremely clean throughout, clear and helpful communication and many extras like a variety of coffees (and cream), a large flat screen tv and well stocked bathroom and kitchen supplies.  Courtney was very helpful with parking registration and bike storage as well which we appreciated. The location is within a few blocks of the grocery store, restaurants, shops and the Elbow River trails. We hope to stay again when we return to Calgary.",
      "had a wonderful stay at this Airbnb in Calgary! The location is excellent \u2014 close to shops, restaurants, and just a short trip to downtown. It was incredibly easy to get around from here. The space itself is quaint, cozy, and has everything you need to feel right at home. The bed was unbelievably comfortable \u2014 one of the best sleeps I\u2019ve had in a while! Would I stay here again? ABSOLUTELY!!",

      "Amazing property, perfect location where it is peaceful yet walkable to downtown. Well decorated and full of amenities!",

      "Perfect stay! Spotless nice apartment with everything what you need. Courtney was always reachable and we really enjoyed our stay.",

      "Great neighbourhood full of restaurants, easy access to groceries and a plethora of coffee spots.  You can walk to the river for a nature hit and walk downtown for work.<br/>Tastefully decorated, with many beautiful heritage details, and a well equipped kitchen. <br/>Great value.",

The layout is great, it\u2019s roomy and the perfect size for one person or a couple.

After a not-so-nice stay at a different Airbnb that we were forced to end early, Courtney absolutely saved the day by allowing us to check in early and treating us so nicely when I had particular requirements related to needing to have no scent/chemicals used on my linen. She never made me feel like a burden or that it was too much to ask. Every interaction was speedy, friendly and she provided ample detail on her instructions. <br/>As for the apartment- WOW. Styled to perfection. The surrounding area was lovely to walk around with lots of amenities nearby and beautiful to look at. The bed is supportive and on the firmer side. Plenty of storage/cupboard space. It had everything we needed. Could easily have stayed here for months! We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would 10/10 stay again. Courtney- you are an amazing host!

      "We had a wonderful stay at Najam\u2019s place! Najam was an excellent host - very easy to communicate, helpful throughout our stay and very nice. The Apartment was clean and well-equipped, location was great and the underground parking was incredibly convenient. Highly recommended!!",
      "A beautiful apartment and a beautiful view! Looking forward to staying here again, very clean and lots to do in the area! Easy check in and clear instructions",
      "Their place is amazing and would recommend the stay to anyone!! 11/10 stay:) would stay again.",
      "The view is amazing 10/10, and the place is very clean. Highly recommend to anyone who is staying in town.",
      "Najam was great. He was very responsive, gave clear instructions and was a very good host. Check in was a breeze and he was very accommodating and",
      "Great place overall. The kitchen is better equipped than lots of airbnbs in some ways, and yet was missing some key items if you want to cook full meals from scratch (no chef's knife, bread knife, grater, or vegetable peeler, and the non-stick frypan is too scraped up to use safely, coffee was supplied but no tea). In every other way, the apartment felt generously welcoming and comfortable.",
      "Beautifully clean condo in a fun location, close to a variety of restaurants and in a vibrant area.  Gorgeous view of downtown.  Had a great stay.  Only caution is the parkade is a bit tight and it would be challenging to maneuver a large vehicle (e.g a truck).  But that said, it's very nice to have heated and secure parking.",
      "Najam and his co-hosts were amazing. Super quick and easy to communicate with from start to finish, which made everything very smooth. The place has an incredible view and is in such a convenient spot downtown. The underground parking was a great bonus, especially in winter. I\u2019d definitely recommend staying here!",
      "What a WONDERFUL spot!!!<br/>Spotless, organized and an easy walk anywhere\u2026.we loved our time here and will definitely be back to enjoy it all over again:)",
      "Was a great place, mum and me were on a little getaway highly recommend if<br/>your wanting a great place in downtown.",
      "Clean, great location and all details communicated clearly. I would stay again!",
      "Great host, responsiveness was swift, easy check in and out!",
      "Excellent location in downtown Calgary. Really nice condo with a great view!",
      "Nice apartment with good location for our family attending Calgary Stampede for the 1st time.",
      "This place was very clean with a beautiful view of downtown Calgary . The check in and out was very easy and Najam is helpful if you have any questions. I would recommend this bnb !!",
      "I had a wonderful stay at this Airbnb! The place was spotless, cozy, and exactly as described. The host was very responsive and helpful throughout my visit. The location was perfect, close to everything I needed. I especially loved the little touches like the welcome snacks and local tips. The bed was super comfortable, and I felt right at home. Check-in and check-out were smooth and hassle-free. Overall, it was a great experience, and I\u2019d definitely recommend it to anyone visiting the area. I would happily stay here again!",
      "Great place to stay in Calgary! If you like being downtown, this is the spot. I\u2019d recommend this place to friends and family, for sure. Will definitely stay here again in the future!",
      "We had a lovely stay. The check-in and check-out was seamless with good communication prior. The unit has a nice view, layout, and good kitchen and laundry machine.  My little one's travel crib fit in the smaller room with the closet doors open and made for a dark room for naps and he loved the view from the couch. Overall the value is good too as it's a several minute walk from the Telus Centre and much more affordable than staying at a conference hotel which doesn't even include parking. I'd happily stay there again I need to!",
      "Really great spot, looks a hidden gem from the outside. <br/>Awesome location to walk to downtown and easy for 17th Avenue. <br/>Great bars and restaurants on the doorstep.<br/>The view of the Calgary skyline was stunning. Would definitely stay again",
      "Our stay was great. The place was incredibly clean, including all linens. The beds were very comfortable. It is a smaller condo, and may be tight for 4 people for an extended period, but it was very comfortable for 2 people. The host was very communicative and quick to respond. The check in instructions and details for our stay were crystal clear and easy to follow. We did have one issue when checking in, however the host was very quick to respond and fix the issue. The building is a little tired, but the apartment was totally fine and updated. We would stay here again."

      "Overall great. Good location, nice view from the apartment, and really response host. Checking in and out is a bit of a pain if you have a car. Need to find street parking which was tough, then get inside to get the key/garage remote to move the car inside. Same thing in reverse on the way out. Not a deal killer, I\u2019d stay again.",
      "I loved staying at Maggie's place. The location is absolutely perfect, with great food and night life options all around. The pictures very much represent the vibe - it's spacious, clean, and serene. I would totally stay here again if I am ever back in town! Maggie is also a great host and always willing to help. 10/10!",
      "We were in Calgary to visit our son and his girlfriend for 9 days. Maggie was super to deal with- informative and quickly responds to any inquiries. The airbnb was clean and located close to fantastic restaurants and bars. Thank you for making our stay in Calgary enjoyable, we will definitely be back!",
      "Maggie was a great host. Instructions for our stay (checking in and out were clear). Place was clean and as advertised. Good location and was great to have a dedicated parking spot. One thing to note if people are light sleepers (which we are) is the front bedroom gets noise from the streets (cars with loud exhaust, sirens from ambulance or police car and people celebrating on the street) and can be heard late into the night.",
      "The condo was clean, well equipped with a full kitchen and great amenities. Its location was good , within walking distance to both the Calgary Stampede grounds and downtown. <br/>T<br/>he host was quick in responding and accommodating, allowing us to drop off our luggage before check-in. <br/>While the bed and pillows could have been more comfortable and having blackout shades in the bedroom with windows would be convenient to block out the outside lights, overall it was a lovely place to stay for a short visit.",
      "The apartment was ideal for our trip with two small kids. We especially enjoyed the two separate bedrooms, the great view, the playground right around the corner and the busy and beautiful area.",
      "This condo is beautiful and in a great location! There's lots to do and places to eat. It's also a great landing spot for visiting the surrounding areas and still coming back to have that \"downtown\" experience. Would absolutely stay here again!",
      "We had a great stay, walkable distance to a lot of places. Although black out curtains would have been nice for the bedroom, the large windows were great to look at the view of the city! Maggie was a great host, allowing us to have a flexible check in/check out time, which we appreciate as not a lot of host could accommodate that request. Overall a good experience! :)",

      "Maggie\u2019s place was the perfect home base for our first Calgary Stampede!<br/>It was comfortable and spacious for our group of four girls, with everything we needed for a fun and easy stay. The location was fantastic\u2014super convenient for getting to the Stampede grounds quickly, but also tucked away enough for a good night\u2019s sleep.<br/>Having in-suite laundry was a total bonus (especially during Stampede week!), and the space was clean, well-stocked, and welcoming.<br/>This was our first Stampede, but definitely not our last\u2014and we\u2019d book Maggie\u2019s again in a heartbeat. Highly recommend.",

      "The area is nice, the apartment is ideal and simple but has everything needed.<br/>I was surprised to see so many rules at check in page and not the Airbnb advertising which was a bit confusing because I could only read them after checking in. Besides that small wave of information, everything was perfect",
      "We had such a great stay at Beth\u2019s place! The location was awesome, walkable to so many restaurants & shopping! <br/>Big bonus that it had parking for our rental car<br/>Instructions for every part of check in and check out were so clear, and easy to follow :) <br/>Would definitely stay again \u2014 thanks Beth for hosting us\ud83e\udd17",
      "We were very happy with our stay. The location is close to many restaurants, shopping etc. Beth was an excellent host who was quick to respond and courteous.. Would highly recommend when staying near the downtown core.",
      "I had a great stay here! The apartment was very clean, comfortable, and exactly as described. The huge private patio was such a great feature and made the place feel extra special. The location was excellent, with so many great spots to eat and shop nearby. The hosts were wonderful, super friendly and quick to respond to any questions I had, which made everything easy and stress-free. I\u2019d definitely recommend this place to anyone visiting Calgary and would stay again!",
      "After being let down by Airbnb one day before our stay in Calgary we found this lovely apartment and it didn\u2019t disappoint <br/>Everything was spotless and clean with plenty of utensils and a great balcony.<br/>Short walk to downtown Calgary.<br/>Uber\u2019s were never more than 2 minutes away if you need them.<br/>We were very fortunate to be the first people staying here.",
      "The condo was lovely and easy to get to, with clear instructions for check-in. It\u2019s in a great area with lots nearby, very clean, and has a nice balcony. I\u2019d definitely recommend staying here!!!",
      "Beth was a wonderful, responsive host. We booked this property as a family of four and I will say it's on the smaller side and probably wasn't the best fit for us. The pool is quite a bit smaller than anticipated but the patio on the deck is accurate to description. If you plan on visiting and being on foot I would be cautious of the heavy homeless population due to the bottle depot being next door, otherwise for us travelling in a vehicle, this wasn't an issue.  Check in and check out was straight forward and the property was cleaned and well maintained.",
      "The location was great as it was close to everything you might need and within easy reach of some of Calgary\u2019s coolest neighborhoods. The place was clean and very comfortable, with all the basic kitchen essentials provided. Everything in the kitchen was new and stylish, which made cooking easy and enjoyable. The balcony is also a nice spot to relax.<br/>Although the description and house rules use somewhat strict, security-focused language that feels a bit off at first, the actual stay was very comfortable and pleasant.",
      "Great communication, super easy check in process. The condo itself was very spacious and beautiful with a massive patio.",
      "The apartment is very nice in a convenient and walkable area of Calgary. Beth was very responsive and helpful. Had a great stay and looking forward to coming back!",
      "Great location great outdoor space if you like having private to work or chill",
      "We had the best time and the apartment and location was a major part of that!  We will be back for sure!",
      "Super clean and great location.",
      "Central location, responsive host, clean place",
      "It is a very tidy and modern accommodation within walking distance of the city center! It was also convenient to use Uber! The rooms are separated, so it seems suitable for 2-3 people. It was very clean and well-equipped with cooking utensils, so it was great! (There were also two coffee machines) It was a very satisfying stay because you quickly resolved the things I was curious about! I recommend it! :) **Oh, the swimming pool was so small that I didn't use it!",
      "Clean, organized space with great instructions!",
      "this is my second time staying at this property and it was great again.",

If you plan on visiting and being on foot I would be cautious of the heavy homeless population due to the bottle depot being next door, otherwise for us travelling in a vehicle, this wasn't an issue.

      "The place is beautiful and comfortable. Loved living in the heart of Downtown. Apartment had more space than we expected. Perfect for family stays\u2026will definitely love to stay again in future.",
      "Had a great stay! Was easy to access instructions on check-in were clear. We did have one hiccup on check out though as we were instructed to leave the keys in the unit but it was not made clear that you need to get your car out of the parkade before leaving the keys behind. We got stranded in the lobby and couldn\u2019t get back up to the unit as we didn\u2019t have the fob, also couldn\u2019t get down into the parkade without the fob. Luckily a gentleman who lives in the building was nice enough to let us into the parkade to get our vehicle. Other than this the unit was decent and overall quite clean. I would happily stay here again.",
      "This was by far the worst Airbnb I\u2019ve stayed in & I do not recommend it. After booking, we learned check-in required walking 10 minutes to another location to pick up keys. The provided link for underground parking was useless; no payment option existed so we had to park on the street. Upon entry, we were met with an overwhelming odor of cigarette smoke & a hockey gym bag that lingered in the bedding, towels & furniture. Cleanliness was nonexistent - crumbs, stains, a dirty Kleenex under the uncomfortable couch that had a metal rod running throughout. Hair & dirt on the rug, random stains on the bedding, walls & ceiling, & dust on nearly every surface. A sticker on the fridge telling guests to leave high ratings felt highly inappropriate. After only 2 hours, we left & booked a hotel at 3 a.m. Hosts showed zero concern for our experience & only cared about the keys.Unclean, unprofessional - never again. Only pro was location. I\u2019d have a lot more to say more if there weren\u2019t a word count",
      "Really enjoyed my stay the place was great great location very clean. Everything worked. Would love to stay again.",
      "Well,I found this place is very affordable and close to all locations like restaurants,mall and so many places to visit.<br/>Place is really nice and peaceful.Everything well organized and I will definitely love to rebook if I get a chance to come to Calgary again.",
      "Will come again soon! Samantha is awesome host!!!!",
      "Great place and close to everything. Would easily come back if visiting Calgary again",
      "Pros: Great location\u2014walking distance to bars, restaurants, and downtown/17th Ave. The unit is clean, well-maintained, and looks like the photos. Secure building with easy check-in.<br/>Cons: The unit lacks warmth and feels bare. The couch is stiff and uncomfortable, with metal bars running through the cushions. The kitchen is poorly stocked\u2014no ice trays and minimal essentials, making it impractical for cooking.<br/>The real issue? Greed. I had a medical emergency during the first night and had to leave for the hospital, meaning I never even stayed in the unit. Despite this, the host refused a date change, even though it was Valentine\u2019s Day weekend and could have been rebooked. Worse, they changed the door code without notice, locking me out for 1.5 hours when I returned for my luggage. I was still charged a full cleaning fee for a unit I barely used.<br/>Overall: The unit itself is decent, but the host\u2019s lack of empathy and money-first attitude left me with a bad impression :(",
      "Amazing place great host would stay again",
      "Great apartment!",
      "We had an amazing stay, and would stay here again in the future if able to, the place is even better in person and is right in the heart of downtown Calgary making it very easy to get around the area with plenty of things to do.",
      "Condo was clean and comfortable and hosts are very responsive. <br/>Little bit of a surprise to find we couldn\u2019t park in underground parking until paying an additional fee after we\u2019d already got into the condo (maybe I missed that in the description?) , but once that was sorted everything else was seamless. <br/>Hosts were quick to respond when we messaged and checked in later that day to make sure everything was going alright. <br/>Great hosts and a nice place in a convenient location.",
      "Overall really great stay!! So much to do in the area, great location to walk from, enjoy restaurants and downtown. Ample towels and other amenities.  Great value, great location and would recommend.",
      "We enjoyed our stay here. The hosts are quick to respond and helpful when needed. The condo met our needs: the location was fantastic and the space was well laid out and decorated.",
      "Super nice place",
      "Great location and very easy to get around the City.<br/>Very cozy and well maintained.<br/>Would stay there again.",
      "From start to finish this was a pretty terrible experience. The hosts was not flexible with the check-in time and only provided check-in instructions 2 hours or so before the designated time. There was only 1 set of keys available for 3 people which was very surprising given that the place is listed to accommodate 4. The host was unable to provide an extra set of keys despite asking for this in advance. Then, the AC was broken and the condo was at 28.5 degrees, which was completely uninhabitable. For 4 (business) days the host was saying it was being repaired and a technician was coming, but no one ever showed up. The host clearly had no intention of ever fixing anything and I am pretty sure I was speaking with an AI for the most part. Would not recommend, it was completely unreasonable to live in a condo at 28.5 degrees and the host misled us in saying it was being repaired.",
      "Great location. Host was helpful. I would stay here again. Thank you",
      "One of the best Airbnb for games nights spacious, clean and at-home-vibe",
      "Place was cozy, clean and in an ideal location.  I would rebook again.",
      "Very friendly owners. Enjoyed staying here all weekend. The building is quiet too.",
      "Great location to explore downtown Calgary.",
      "highly recommend would definitely stay again",
      "Very beautiful apartment, clean and spacious, conveniently located near shops and restaurants close to commercial downtown.<br/>The building is beautiful with a peaceful atmosphere.<br/>Host was cordial and helpful.<br/>We would stay again any time."

We did have one hiccup on check out though as we were instructed to leave the keys in the unit but it was not made clear that you need to get your car out of the parkade before leaving the keys behind. We got stranded in the lobby and couldn\u2019t get back up to the unit as we didn\u2019t have the fob, also couldn\u2019t get down into the parkade without the fob. Luckily a gentleman who lives in the building was nice enough to let us into the parkade to get our vehicle. Other than this the unit was decent and overall quite clean. I would happily stay here again.",

        "review": "This was by far the worst Airbnb I\u2019ve stayed in & I do not recommend it. After booking, we learned check-in required walking 10 minutes to another location to pick up keys. The provided link for underground parking was useless; no payment option existed so we had to park on the street. Upon entry, we were met with an overwhelming odor of cigarette smoke & a hockey gym bag that lingered in the bedding, towels & furniture. Cleanliness was nonexistent - crumbs, stains, a dirty Kleenex under the uncomfortable couch that had a metal rod running throughout. Hair & dirt on the rug, random stains on the bedding, walls & ceiling, & dust on nearly every surface. A sticker on the fridge telling guests to leave high ratings felt highly inappropriate. After only 2 hours, we left & booked a hotel at 3 a.m. Hosts showed zero concern for our experience & only cared about the keys.Unclean, unprofessional - never again. Only pro was location. I\u2019d have a lot more to say more if there weren\u2019t a word count",

Secure building with easy check-in.<br/>Cons: The unit lacks warmth and feels bare. The couch is stiff and uncomfortable, with metal bars running through the cushions. The kitchen is poorly stocked\u2014no ice trays and minimal essentials, making it impractical for cooking.<br/>The real issue? Greed. I had a medical emergency during the first night and had to leave for the hospital, meaning I never even stayed in the unit. Despite this, the host refused a date change, even though it was Valentine\u2019s Day weekend and could have been rebooked. Worse, they changed the door code without notice, locking me out for 1.5 hours when I returned for my luggage. I was still charged a full cleaning fee for a unit I barely used.<br/>Overall: The unit itself is decent, but the host\u2019s lack of empathy and money-first attitude left me with a bad impression :(",

The hosts was not flexible with the check-in time and only provided check-in instructions 2 hours or so before the designated time. There was only 1 set of keys available for 3 people which was very surprising given that the place is listed to accommodate 4. The host was unable to provide an extra set of keys despite asking for this in advance. Then, the AC was broken and the condo was at 28.5 degrees, which was completely uninhabitable. For 4 (business) days the host was saying it was being repaired and a technician was coming, but no one ever showed up. The host clearly had no intention of ever fixing anything and I am pretty sure I was speaking with an AI for the most part. Would not recommend, it was completely unreasonable to live in a condo at 28.5 degrees and the host misled us in saying it was being repaired.",

      "I had a wonderful stay at this location. It was just me and my son and there\u2019s lots of restaurants around right downtown so we could go shopping and there was a perky that was very cheap right across the street for us to park in for the weekend.<br/>Everything in her apartment was very clean and she also had Netflix, which was a plus . I would recommend this place to anybody.",
      "Great stay. The place was cozy, clean, and perfectly located. Everything was walkable and easy to access. Maria was incredibly communicative and helpful throughout. Would definitely stay here again.",
      "We had a fantastic stay during the Calgary Stampede! The location was perfect, just a short walk to all the main attractions and events. It was super easy to get around, and the host was incredibly responsive and helpful with any questions we had. Highly recommend!",
      "We stayed at Maria's place over Stampede and the location was excellent for walking to the grounds and many wonderful local restaurants (our favourite was Ten Foot Henry). We found the unit fairly tight for 3 people but it would be great for a couple. During Stampede it's worth noting the windows aren't soundproofed, and they rattle with the local music which runs until around 2am each night. As we have a 10 year old, we were all in bed by 9pm, but if you plan to attend the late night events, it's likely a perfect location for you!",

I would recommend her place to anyone spending some time in Calgary. Every thing you could possibly need from great restaurants to entertainment is all walkable.",

Maria took care of every little thing you can think of - from the hook for your coat and place to put your purse to the barbecue on the balcony.

      "I had a good stay overall, unfortunately I ran into a number of issues where all drain pipes were clogged from the kitchen to the bathroom for a couple days after my arrival until it was fixed. The towel rack in the bathroom is completely ripped off the wall and missing, and missing light bulbs in the bathroom make the lighting horrible, far from being as bright as in the pictures but much more dimmed. The floor was also sticky so I'm glad I had packed a pair of slides to walk around. The kitchen only has the basics which was not always great for cooking. The balcony definitely needed a cleanup so I never used it. Like other comments said, the bed in the main bedroom is very uncomfortable but I didn't have to use it fortunately. I mostly liked the area which is great and very walkable, with a decent number of coffee shops and restaurants around.",
      "From the smooth check in to our departure, this was a delightful experience <br/>The variety of restaurants was a surprise. Good food.",
      "Jo, Mary and Amber are great hosts respectively. We did have a number of issues but communication was so well respected between us. They just took care of all our problems. It's been a coincidence that I am booking with them for the second time, but now I will look out for their ads whenever I book in Calgary.<br/>Thanks n Kudos to all of you!",
      "Friendly and quick-responding host, cozy accommodation in a good location! Recommended!",
      "Me and my husband stayed for one month at Joe and Marie\u2019s apartment, and we were totally happy we had chosen it. <br/>The location was great and convenient, few steps away from the best restaurants, a big shopping center and the most of attractions. The view was amazing. And the apartment itself was everything we could expect and more.",
      "I lived in the apartment for a whole week , the apartment is very nice and located in the very center. <br/>Clean, coffee was there, bed and towels smelled nice. <br/>The host was quick to respond to questions. <br/>Every thing it was very good.<br/>The only disadvantage was the clogged sink in the kitchen, but perhaps this problem is in the house itself. <br/>Thank you very much for your stay, we will definitely stay again.",
      "We had a pleasant stay overall, but there were a couple of areas for improvement. Communication with the host could have been better; I requested a second key to facilitate logistics since there were two of us staying, but I didn\u2019t receive a response. Additionally, the mattress in the main bedroom was quite worn and uncomfortable, deforming during the night to the point that I had to sleep on the couch for half of the stay. Addressing these issues would enhance the overall experience. Otherwise, we appreciated the property and its amenities.",
      "this was a great location but, the place is not in great shape. missing light bulbs, closet doors that don't function, the master bed has a problem, it sinks in the middle. the balcony could you use a clean, cigarette butts, Etc. kitchen had only the basics.",
      "Nice place",
      "The place is very nice and clean. The hosts are very friendly and helpful with the information about the place. Would recommend for a visit to Calgary",
      "Very nice place! It was all clean and the host is really kind.",
      "Great location, bright open apartment & fantastic hosts.",
      "You have to make small compromises, especially there was a problem with the elevator that required a lot of waiting time. There are certainly luxurious apartments, but the value for money is unbeatable. That's why the conclusion \u2013 highly recommended.",
      "We stayed in the apartment for three weeks. The apartment has a very convenient location in the city center, close to C-train, restaurants, shops. Convenient parking space in the parking lot. I was pleased with the gorgeous view. There were questions about cleaning the apartment, but the host quickly resolved this issue! In general, I recommend it.",
      "Very clean and great place for a super great price since your only 10-15 minutes away from downtown",
      "Mary, Joe and Amber were amazing hosts! This was my very first Airbnb booking and things couldn\u2019t have been easier. <br/>Our hosts were EXTREMELY responsive and friendly and made things very easy for myself and family (I was travelling with my parents who are in their 70s). <br/>Considering that this location was in a busy part of the downtown area, you couldn\u2019t hear much of the outdoor noise (minus a few revving engines and sirens), which made for restful nights. We were able to walk to Stampede Park, which was an added bonus. <br/>Again, this is in the downtown core, so be prepared to experience some of the eccentricity that comes with that, however, we did not feel unsafe at any time. <br/>The space was clean and there was plenty of storage space.  An extra key/fob would have been great since there were times when we were not all together as a group and maybe access to a fitness room (if allowed). <br/>Would definitely consider booking here again!",
      "Place was good. Check in was a complete disaster unfortunately but everything else was good.",
      "Good apartment, position and host!",
      "Great location! Nice view and hosts were very responsive.",
      "Great location. We enjoyed our stay.",
      "Lovely condo and would book again when in the area.",
      "The house is clean, in a good location, and the apartment is walking distance to restaurants and supermarkets.It would be better if there was a large lamp in the living room."

        "review": "I had a good stay overall, unfortunately I ran into a number of issues where all drain pipes were clogged from the kitchen to the bathroom for a couple days after my arrival until it was fixed. The towel rack in the bathroom is completely ripped off the wall and missing, and missing light bulbs in the bathroom make the lighting horrible, far from being as bright as in the pictures but much more dimmed. The floor was also sticky so I'm glad I had packed a pair of slides to walk around. The kitchen only has the basics which was not always great for cooking. The balcony definitely needed a cleanup so I never used it. Like other comments said, the bed in the main bedroom is very uncomfortable but I didn't have to use it fortunately. I mostly liked the area which is great and very walkable, with a decent number of coffee shops and restaurants around.",
        "host_response": "Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback. We\u2019re glad to hear you enjoyed the area and found the location convenient. We sincerely apologize for the maintenance issues you experienced during your stay \u2014 including the clogged drains, lighting, and towel rack. These have since been addressed, and we\u2019re taking additional steps to ensure they don\u2019t happen again. We also appreciate your notes about the balcony and kitchen setup, as they help us identify where we can improve. We value your feedback and hope to have the chance to provide a smoother stay in the future."

This was my very first Airbnb booking and things couldn\u2019t have been easier. <br/>Our hosts were EXTREMELY responsive and friendly and made things very easy for myself and family (I was travelling with my parents who are in their 70s). <br/>Considering that this location was in a busy part of the downtown area, you couldn\u2019t hear much of the outdoor noise (minus a few revving engines and sirens), which made for restful nights. We were able to walk to Stampede Park, which was an added bonus. <br/>Again, this is in the downtown core, so be prepared to experience some of the eccentricity that comes with that, however, we did not feel unsafe at any time. <br/>The space was clean and there was plenty of storage space.  An extra key/fob would have been great since there were times when we were not all together as a group and maybe access to a fitness room (if allowed). <br/>Would definitely consider booking here again!",

      "This place was definitely worth the stay! It looked exactly like the pictures, clean, comfortable, and well-kept. The location was great too, with plenty to do around the area like restaurants. I\u2019d definitely stay here again!",
      "This was one of the best, if not the best Airbnb that I\u2019ve stayed in. Adam was an amazing host - extremely informative, responsive and helpful. The attention to detail in the apartment was on point. Everything was as described and even better in person. The apartment was spotlessly clean and really was like a home away from home with everything that we needed. The location was also really convenient and within walking distance to many areas in Calgary, there were also lots of restaurant choices nearby.",
      "Overall, great stay. Apt was a little smaller, then what I anticipated but the bathroom was a great size,  which was a plus. <br/>Home was upscale. Extremely clean. Had everything needed. <br/>My GPS did bring me to the Marriott so if you arrive at the Marriott,  you\u2019ve gone too far. Be prepared to pay for parking. <br/>The views from the bedroom and patio were beautiful! <br/>If you\u2019re into Italian, highly recommend Toscana. 10/10  I had the chicken parm with pene. <br/>Overall, would stay again. <br/>Would stay again.",
      "Excellent location in downtown Calgary! Super clean! Adam was super helpful and went out of his way to help us out after hours as our flight arrived late. Would stay here again in the Calgary area!",
      "Very nice condo. Adam was amazing and even helped us out when we had a small issue (unrelated to the condo). <br/>Beautiful view that we enjoyed from the balcony. Extremely clean, well stocked. We would 100% stay again.",
      "A very enjoyable stay access to everything I needed. The unit includes some lovely additions features. Felt right at home.<br/>Would recommend this little appartment with an amazing view",
      "We loved the beautiful flat which was well located. Safeway close by and a short walk to the Core shopping mall. Loved having some restaurants right there and within walking distance. Would definitely stay again. Thank you Adam",
      "Everything was perfect. Nicely decorated and SO CLEAN!! LOVED the balcony. Comfy bed. The bathroom felt like a spa with the nice smelling shampoo etc provided. I like that the sheets and towels are all white - makes it feel extra clean. Walkable location. Good communication from host. Check in might be a little tricky for someone not techy because you use your phone, but wasn't a problem for us. Paid parking lot right across the street. Definitely going to stay here again next time I'm in Calgary.",
      "Great place to stay at! The view was amazing, clean & aesthetic, had plenty of amenities for our stay. It was easy to locate and the front security was helpful in check in process. There was ample of parking, which we were worried about since it was downtown. Adam was accommodating during our stay and we tried one of his recommended locations which turned out to be the most delightful dinner we\u2019ve had.",
      "I had a great stay! The place was comfortable, clean, and exactly as described. The location was perfect \u263a\ufe0f close to everything I wanted to explore, with easy access to public transport and local spots. Highly recommend for anyone visiting the area! \u263a\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f",
      "The condo was immaculate and very comfortable with a great balcony which had such a good view of the Calgary Tower. Very well located for downtown and not too far a walk from the river. Adam was a really responsive host.",
      "We enjoyed our recent stay in Calgary! Everything was on walking distance. Adam was a super host, very responsive. The place is gorgeous and relaxing. We would stay here again!",
      "Had a wonderful stay at Sojourn Aria and I couldn\u2019t fault a single thing. The apartment has been carefully considered for guests and has everything you could possible need.",
      "Absolutely wonderful, cosy and well equipped place to stay in the heart of Calgary. Adam is providing all information and is always available in case of questions. Lovely details in this brand new apartment; felt like being home from the first second on. Would come back for sure. Thanks a lot!",
      "Great place, so clean. Only issue is building is locked from 11pm-7am. Not the fault of the host, but sucks if your flight or travel plans are delayed.",
      "Adam was very communicative and very helpful! Place was beautiful and a nice transitional stay.",
      "What a nice place to stay! The location is great, everything is comfortable and it's a stylish unit! We especially liked the shower and the balcony.",

      "Stayed here for 2 weeks and had everything we needed available.  Many restaurants a short walk away, grocery store just down the street.  View of the city and mountains was mesmerizing and sometimes included hot air balloons in the distance.  Garage parking space is very conveniently located near the entrance and near the elevators.  Communication with property owners was timely and informative.  Great place!",
      "We LOVED, LOVED, LOVED our stay in Kyle & Andrew's apartment / condo. We called it the \"Angel Pad\" ... it felt light, sunny, joyful and full of positive vibes. We loved waking up to and coming home to the views. The sunrises ... amazing! There for 9 days, it came to feel like home away from home. We loved our two \"stay-home\" dinners, just relaxing and enjoying the gentleness - the tone set by the beautiful, light decor. Scarpetta's Italian Restaurant, in the condo building, was delicious. Safeway is a 5 minute walk away. Kyle and Andrew, thank you for a wonderful stay!",
      "Thank you so much to the host ! This place was absolutely amazing with beautiful views! We had a small family getaway and would definitely rebook! The host was also quick to respond and very friendly. Location is super close to restaurant, supermarket and more. 10/10 would recommend",
      "The apartment itself is as per the photo's/description, actually nicely presented and comfortable, it could do with some better blinds; access is somewhat difficult through a slightly difficult to operate entrance interface, b<br/>ut once in there's a key fob which makes this a lot easier.<br/>Unfortunately for us there was a major international open air Electronic Dance music festival adjacent to the apartment occurring at the same time as our visit making it impossible to sleep in the apartment before 02;00. This,  was not advised in advance of our visit.",
      "We had a wonderful stay at Kyle and Andrew\u2019s place and couldn\u2019t recommend more!<br/>The apartment was even better than the pictures showed - spacious, extremely clean and comfortable. It had everything we needed, even down to washing powder for our clothes. The washer and dryer are huge and great for piling the active wear in if you\u2019re visiting Banff National Park.<br/>The building itself is really modern and we loved the patio/pool area (pool is heated to 84 degrees so was comfortable even on cooler days!). We also spent lots of time admiring the view from the balcony out over Calgary and to the mountains on a clear day. <br/>Other reviews mention it being noisy, however this is to be expected if you want to stay in a great city centre location. You\u2019re a stone\u2019s throw from the bustling 17th ave, with loads of great bars and restaurants nearby. <br/>Finally, Kyle and Andrew were extremely attentive with messages and questions. Thanks again for a perfect stay!",
      "Stayed for a few days with my family. The space was fine, but check-in was a problem. We messaged the host 15 minutes before arrival (arrival for 10:02 pm) and were told we couldn\u2019t check in because doors closed at 10 pm and it was our fault for not reading the instructions and that we wouldn\u2019t get a refund. We pointed out that the host\u2019s own previous message said 2 am as the cutoff and sent him a screenshot. After realizing his mistake, the host stopped responding, repeatedly typing and deleting messages which we could see in the chat. He also ignored two calls to the emergency number which he provided. We were stranded outside until a passerby who lived in the building helped us get in and we buzzed the landlord\u2019s number. The landlord was able to message us \"did you buzz in\" the second we did which furthered that he was on his phone and just ghosting us because of his mistake. There were no issues after this point but was disappointed in the way the issue was handled.",
      "The property was even nicer than pictured. It has an amazing city view from all of the floor to ceiling windows which we sat in front of on a nightly basis to admire the city lights. It has an expansive balcony with comfortable chairs where you can sit and watch the city go by! Kyle & Andrew went above and beyond with all of the necessities for daily living. All we had to buy were a few groceries for our 9 day stay. The condo was well furnished and very clean. It was also great to have a full size washer, dryer and dishwasher at hand.  We felt very safe as there is excellent building security.  I would recommend staying at Kyle & Andrew\u2019s property and we will definitely stay there again.",
      "Great condo. Location is close to everything. Good commication with renters",
      "stay was great. check out was a bit rocky but that was not kyle's fault.",
      "Condo is nice and well located. <br/>Kyle is very responsive and condo way as describe.",
      "Great place to stay. Amazing views and I highly recommend.",
      "MAGICAL !!! Love the place ! Very convenient and nice and luxurious",
      "The location is good.However, the host's responses seem to be AI, not human."

View of the city and mountains was mesmerizing and sometimes included hot air balloons in the distance.  Garage parking space is very conveniently located near the entrance and near the elevators.  Communication with property owners was timely and informative.  Great place!",

We loved waking up to and coming home to the views. The sunrises ... amazing! There for 9 days, it came to feel like home away from home. We loved our two \"stay-home\" dinners, just relaxing and enjoying the gentleness - the tone set by the beautiful, light decor. Scarpetta's Italian Restaurant, in the condo building, was delicious. Safeway is a 5 minute walk away. Kyle and Andrew, thank you for a wonderful stay!",

It had everything we needed, even down to washing powder for our clothes. The washer and dryer are huge and great for piling the active wear in if you\u2019re visiting Banff National Park.<br/>The building itself is really modern and we loved the patio/pool area (pool is heated to 84 degrees so was comfortable even on cooler days!). We also spent lots of time admiring the view from the balcony out over Calgary and to the mountains on a clear day. <br/>Other reviews mention it being noisy, however this is to be expected if you want to stay in a great city centre location. You\u2019re a stone\u2019s throw from the bustling 17th ave, with loads of great bars and restaurants nearby. <br/>Finally, Kyle and Andrew were extremely attentive with messages and questions. Thanks again for a perfect stay!",

        "review": "Stayed for a few days with my family. The space was fine, but check-in was a problem. We messaged the host 15 minutes before arrival (arrival for 10:02 pm) and were told we couldn\u2019t check in because doors closed at 10 pm and it was our fault for not reading the instructions and that we wouldn\u2019t get a refund. We pointed out that the host\u2019s own previous message said 2 am as the cutoff and sent him a screenshot. After realizing his mistake, the host stopped responding, repeatedly typing and deleting messages which we could see in the chat. He also ignored two calls to the emergency number which he provided. We were stranded outside until a passerby who lived in the building helped us get in and we buzzed the landlord\u2019s number. The landlord was able to message us \"did you buzz in\" the second we did which furthered that he was on his phone and just ghosting us because of his mistake. There were no issues after this point but was disappointed in the way the issue was handled.",

It has an expansive balcony with comfortable chairs where you can sit and watch the city go by! Kyle & Andrew went above and beyond with all of the necessities for daily living. All we had to buy were a few groceries for our 9 day stay. The condo was well furnished and very clean. It was also great to have a full size washer, dryer and dishwasher at hand.  We felt very safe as there is excellent building security.  I would recommend staying at Kyle & Andrew\u2019s property and we will definitely stay there again.",

      "It was my first time to stay at a luxury airbnb, and I called this place my penthouse. From the mesmerizing view to spacious area, everything was perfect and very cozy. I felt very safe staying there alone with the building strict access system. I will definitely choose this airbnb if I ever visit Calgary again! Thank you for the great stay.",
      "Kyle\u2019s place was excellent, from the beginning communication was clear and concise. The condo was in great shape and an excellent location. The View! The pictures in the ad did not do this justice, waking up and having a cup of coffee while looking at the mountains was excellent. I would highly recommend this unit to anyone",
      "Had a wonderful time in this stunning condo! It was centrally located, very spacious, and clean. Both mornings I woke up to  beautiful views of the city and air balloons over the mountains from a distance. Just steps away from pubs and restaurants, meaning I didn't have to stray too far if I didn't want to. I'd highly recommend this one, and can't wait to come back!",

Loved the glass window wall; hot water; great location for walking to all the things including delicious neighborhood eateries, Thai massage and grocery store. Kyle\u2019s communication was superb. I\u2019ve already recommended to a friend who booked a stay and will certainly return. 18 min walk to the Saddledome. Go Flames!",

      "Alizeh was a great hostess!!! Very responsive with communication and so patient with me as I had a hard time with the door code. The place was beautifully decorated. Appreciated the coffee, creamer and sugar. Bed was super comfortable! Great location with lots to do; terrific restaurants and coffee shops.",
      "Alizeh\u2019s unit was the perfect size for a couple and 1 or 2 children.  The location is right in the downtown with restaurants and bars, entertainment, and nice areas to walk by the river.  There\u2019s a fantastic view from the 12th floor with floor to ceiling windows.   Visiting Calgary was made all the better by this lodging\u2019s location.  We highly recommend Alizeh\u2019s AirBnB.",
      "Our stay at Alizeh\u2019s place was great - The instructions for check in were clear, the apartment looked exactly like the photos, and everything went smoothly! Definitely recommend booking!",

      "Overall, our stay was great. Alizeh was incredibly responsive - quick, thorough, and very helpful. The location was incredibly convenient.<br/>A few notes if folks are staying on the couch: <br/>- Bring an eye mask (the blinds are very thin).<br/>- The bedroom has a sliding door and an opening to the kitchen near the ceiling, so bring ear plugs.<br/>- You have to go through the bedroom to get to the bathroom. <br/>- But the pull out couch is pretty big and comfy!",
      "This place is STUNNING! It is my new favourite place to stay in Calgary. It\u2019s so cozy and felt like a home away from home. The parking stalls in this building are usually quite tight but this one seemed more manageable than others. Alizeh was very wonderful and responsive as well! I can\u2019t wait to go back!",

I would definitely recommend if you want to be close to downtown but still be in fairly quiet area. Would stay again!",

      "Kyle and Andrew were super responsive, easy to reach and helpful. Their place is very well designed, immaculately clean and in a great location in Calgary. It was easy to get around for the two days of business I was there for. The apartment had everything I needed and was only a 7 minute walk to the grocery store. There is a decent Italian restaurant in the ground floor of the building which was super convenient. The booking process was easy. The king size bed was really comfortable and I had a great sleep. Check out was easy. I would highly recommend staying in this condo if you are visiting Calgary and I hope to return again.",

Great food in the area and I will definitely be staying again.",

There is a decent Italian restaurant in the ground floor of the building which was super convenient. The booking process was easy. The king size bed was really comfortable and I had a great sleep. Check out was easy. I would highly recommend staying in this condo if you are visiting Calgary and I hope to return again.",

      "Tina and Steve were AMAZING! They were so responsive to communication and any questions that I had. The space was super clean, conveniently located, and exactly as described. This would be a great space for a travelling professional to stay or a group of friends visiting the city, as there is a lot of space and the location is great! Overall, highly recommend staying here!",
      "We used Tina and Steve's airbnb as my bridal suite, it was close to the venue, it had a beautiful view, it was clean and the space worked for what we needed it for. It was a bit small for the amount of people we had getting ready but we enjoyed our time there regardless! The only complaint we had was relying on the key fobe so much and the initial check in/parking situation, other than that the space is beautiful and perfect.",
      "This place was as advertised. Comfortable beds everything was clean and the kitchen was well equipped. Very responsive hosts. Would stay again in a heartbeat.  close to shopping, bars, and restaurants. There is a bottle depot and a safe injection site in close proximity, so there are a few people who are strung out in the area. This is not uncommon and big cities and didn\u2019t bother us.",
      "While the unit was well taken care of and in a good location, the check-in and check-out process was confusing and difficult. The sheer number of instructions for the check-in was cumbersome, yet somehow lacked any amount of clarity for the check-out process. In particular, the process for picking up and returning the keyfob for the building added unnecessary stress and time to our stay. While it is clear the hosts have put effort into making the process easier to understand, it still needs significant streamlining and refinement.",
      "The unit was super cute and just the right size for us four girls, the location was great and Tina and Steve communicated good. We just had a little problem with the FOB when arriving which made check in a little difficult but it all worked out in the end! We enjoyed our stay",

      "We had a great stay. Was very easy to manage with kids in tow. Very easy to walk downtown to the c-train or around the neighborhood for a good breakfast stop. Unfortunately there are quite a few homeless gathering spots close by but they didn\u2019t bother us nor our overall stay. We will definitely stay again",
      "I had a wonderful stay at this place! The home was exactly as described\u2014clean, comfortable, and well-equipped with everything I needed. The location was great, close to calgary downtown. Communication with the host was smooth and responsive throughout. I would definitely recommend this Airbnb to anyone visiting the area, and I\u2019d be happy to stay here again!",

      "Absolutely loved my stay here! The hosts were incredibly responsive and provided detailed instructions that made everything easy from start to finish. The place was immaculate! seriously one of the cleanest Airbnbs I\u2019ve stayed in and looked exactly like the photos.

I loved how safe the building is, we had nothing to worry about if we left our things in the apartment. Overall Beautiful<br/>Thank you so much",
      "The apartment was fantastic, and Tina and Steve were very communicative. Our only issue was that the instructions didn\u2019t make it clear that the keyfob collection point was not an easy walk to the apartment (not in minus 17 winds anyway!).

It was a bit small for the amount of people we had getting ready but we enjoyed our time there regardless! The only complaint we had was relying on the key fobe so much and the initial check in/parking situation, other than that the space is beautiful and perfect.",
        "host_response": "Thank you, Courtney! We're glad our unit worked out as your bridal suite. The fob was provided as the building's security measure to ensure only tenants can get in. Best wishes, and we hope to host you again in the future!"

The sheer number of instructions for the check-in was cumbersome, yet somehow lacked any amount of clarity for the check-out process. In particular, the process for picking up and returning the keyfob for the building added unnecessary stress and time to our stay. While it is clear the hosts have put effort into making the process easier to understand, it still needs significant streamlining and refinement.",

      "We had an amazing stay! The apartment is beautiful, clean, and very centrally located \u2014 close to plenty of great restaurants and cafes. The host was very responsive and helpful throughout our stay. A few lights in the kitchen were burned out, and the heater occasionally went on and off, but these were minor issues and didn\u2019t affect our overall experience. We\u2019d definitely stay here again!",
      "This apartment is in a great location to downtown. It had everything you need to make your stay easy, especially the kitchen was very useable and everything in great condition. Plus washing machine is a bonus as we stayed almost a week.<br/>I note that you do need to meet the host for checkin, this was a very smooth process and they were very responsive when we needed to slightly tweak our dates due to a late night flight. Great stay, definitely stay again!",
      "advertised as air conditioned but was not working, seems to be a common issue throughout the reviews. maybe it should not be advertised as ac if it rarely works. made for warm days and uncomfortable nights.",
      "The apartment was clean, comfortable, and well located. However, during my stay my car window was broken while parked in the underground garage. The building had security cameras, but the host told me there were none. This was disappointing, as I had assumed the garage was secure. Guests should be aware that even in the underground parking, incidents can happen.",
      "It was a pity the problems with the air conditioner were not communicated prior to arrival, on arrival the site manager too did not advise, plus damage internally to walls and bedding was inadequate, they did react quickly to repair and restore the next day, but the value and confidence had already been lost.",
      "Pros:<br/>Host is incredibly responsive and kind<br/>Clear instructions on check in/out and parking<br/>Place is clean<br/>Able to offer temporary solutions<br/>Pictures are relatively clear<br/>Many in apartment amenities <br/>Cons:<br/>When I visited there was no central A/C, left the windowless room very stuffy and overall very hot<br/>They sent someone over, tried her best but was clearly didn\u2019t know much about A/C",
      "Thanks for the stay! Great location. Pullout couch is not very comfortable if sleeping 2 on it (the one side is basically just pillows). The decor inside was nice, and place was clean!",
      "Had no A/C and no window to open.  It was HOT.  Otherwise, PERFECT location and great place to stay.  A temp air conditioner was blocking access to cooler night air which would have helped.  EASY to walk around and access nice things in Calgary. Hope to return and I would just make sure we have air conditioner.  It was hot in July and almost 80F in the unit.  Survived.  Made us get out and walk more.  Would rent again.  Can't beat the location for our needs.  Super cute place too.",
      "A perfect location -walkable to the Calgary tower and convention centers.<br/>Beth was very responsive and helpful asi arrived at 1 in the morning-<br/>The beds are very comfortable and the kitchen area has what you need to eat in.<br/>Mahalo Beth",
      "Our stay started out okay. There were a few cleaning issues, i.e. the toilet and the sheets being dirty, but once we brought that up to Your Key, they were proactive, responsive, and quick to address our concerns which we greatly appreciated. Overall, the unit itself was nice and a good place to stay. <br/>However, one thing to note about this specific building: similar to a previous review, our driver's side car window was completely smashed into while parked in the locked underground parking garage and we had stuff stolen from our vehicle. <br/>While this was *not* the fault of the hosts (they were also quick to respond with resources to report the incident to the Calgary Police Service and to offer any assistance they could), it is something to be extremely wary of if you are bringing a vehicle to this Airbnb.",
      "Wonderful space ! Host was amazing, and instructions were very clear. This place was in a wonderful location, within walking distance of a lot of places !",
      "Loved the place, the area and the aesthetic of the apartment!! It was an amazing stay. Made me want to extend our trip!",
      "Clean room and comfortable location! Also room condition and mood is so nice!! I love this room\ud83d\ude06",
      "Condo was good. Clean & tidy. Great location. Nice restaurants near by (walking distance). Easy check-in. We stayed there for 4 nights in Aug 2025. First night was a bit rough as there was an issue with the central AC (was working very slow & not blowing out cold air). Beth's team responded well to the issue. However, the first night it could not be fixed & we were provided with extra fans. Because of the heat wave fans couldn't keep up with the cooling though. Next day there technicians fixed the central AC & also installed an additional portable AC (our last 3 nights were cool & comfy). Thanks! Some minor issues with the light bulbs (not working) in the kitchen, window blinds in the bedroom not working properly which were fixed in a timely manner. Their team was very quick to respond to any issue. Kitchen had all the utensils you would need for a short stay. Stove/Microwave/Dishwasher/laundry/dryer were all in a good working condition. Overall our stay & Beth's team were both great!",
      "staff was responsive and helpful. feels like a staged apartment. <br/>*take Caution with hot water taps *VERY hot<br/> <informed owner / they are taking care of it> <br/>well located building for excursions in city, walking distance to downtown, lots of bird and neuron scooters in area.  free parking is excellent.<br/>grocery stores just East is H-mart and Sunterra. <br/>  Fridge is Bare, coffee and sugar in cabinet.<br/>very happy to have a washer and dryer for laundry in suite.<br/>  Beth you and your staff communicate clearly and rapidly, thanks for the lovely and clean space for our visit.<br/>  bars and restaurants just across street.",
      "Beth's place is in a fantastic location for restaurants and night life. The area is safe and is easily walkable to any area in the downtown core. The condo itself is nicely appointed with comfortable furniture and amenities. The underground parking is easily accessible. I would recommend Beth's place for a downtown Calgary stay.",
      "Great location, super accommodation and facilities. <br/>A bit of an  issue with check in as we had a delayed flight, but other than that would highly recommend.",
      "Very friendly, great location, easy to communicate and the place 10/10.",
      "Had great experience staying at this location. It is very well located in downtown calgary with lots of restaurants around",
      "Place was clean and at a great location. We had an  issue and the host and air bnb were quick to communicate and get back to us.",
      "We really enjoyed our 6 night stay! Great location, easy to find and had everything we needed for a very comfortable visit We loved the view and designer decor! Parking was a huge plus. Our hosts were exceptional and we would highly recommend this gem!",
      "This is a gem in Downtown Calgary, I would definitely go back!",
      "Great stay. Super central in Calgary, great sized place.",
      "Great location in Calgary's Beltline neighbourhood and walking distance to downtown. Very clean and comfortable. The comprehensive guest manual shared in advance made everything a breeze. The included parking in the building was a huge plus. Compared to nearby hotels, it was definitely the right choice for us to stay here. The building clearly has many short term rentals operating here but there was never any issues with noise or cleanliness of the building's common areas. Beth and her team were super proactive and professional, and communication was always prompt. I would not hesitate to stay again."

Hope to return and I would just make sure we have air conditioner.  It was hot in July and almost 80F in the unit.  Survived.  Made us get out and walk more.  Would rent again.

        "review": "Our stay started out okay. There were a few cleaning issues, i.e. the toilet and the sheets being dirty, but once we brought that up to Your Key, they were proactive, responsive, and quick to address our concerns which we greatly appreciated. Overall, the unit itself was nice and a good place to stay. <br/>However, one thing to note about this specific building: similar to a previous review, our driver's side car window was completely smashed into while parked in the locked underground parking garage and we had stuff stolen from our vehicle. <br/>While this was *not* the fault of the hosts (they were also quick to respond with resources to report the incident to the Calgary Police Service and to offer any assistance they could), it is something to be extremely wary of if you are bringing a vehicle to this Airbnb.",
        "host_response": "Hello Eureka,<br/>Thank you for your thoughtful review and for recognizing our team\u2019s professionalism, communication, and quick response. We truly appreciate that. We are very sorry that one linen and a bathroom detail didn\u2019t meet our usual high standards. While the mark shown was faint and fully washed, it\u2019s not the perfection we expect. All of our linens are professionally laundered off-site in commercial-grade machines using high-quality, scent-free products and disinfecting high-heat cycles. Each setup is inspected and photographed before guest arrival, and we\u2019ve reinforced additional checks to ensure consistency across every stay.<br/>When we learned of your concern, our team attended the property immediately to make it right and ensure your comfort. We also provided additional support and flexibility beyond standard policy, because ensuring our guests feel valued and cared for matters most to us.<br/>We are truly sorry about what happened in the shared underground parking garage. As you mentioned, this was an unfortunate event in a communal facility that we don\u2019t manage. While incidents like this are rare, they can happen anywhere, and we always encourage guests to keep valuables out of sight. We were glad to assist right away with resources and guidance for filing a report with Calgary Police Service.<br/>We are grateful you found the unit itself comfortable and appreciated our team\u2019s efforts throughout your stay. Your feedback helps us continually strengthen our operations and uphold the reliability, cleanliness, and integrity that both guests and homeowners can trust with Your Key."

First night was a bit rough as there was an issue with the central AC (was working very slow & not blowing out cold air). Beth's team responded well to the issue. However, the first night it could not be fixed & we were provided with extra fans. Because of the heat wave fans couldn't keep up with the cooling though. Next day there technicians fixed the central AC & also installed an additional portable AC (our last 3 nights were cool & comfy). Thanks! Some minor issues with the light bulbs (not working) in the kitchen, window blinds in the bedroom not working properly which were fixed in a timely manner. Their team was very quick to respond to any issue. Kitchen had all the utensils you would need for a short stay. Stove/Microwave/Dishwasher/laundry/dryer were all in a good working condition. Overall our stay & Beth's team were both great!",

Older building so some finesse required to use the intercom (disconnects) but Tristian and Kenzie were there to safe the day and do a work around. Super grateful for their prompt response after my gfs and I decided our BC road trip needed a rest stop in Alberta before we continued on. Good call on this air bnb!",
      "I stay here frequently for business and always enjoy the place.  The location is great, walking distance to downtown, the Saddle Dome, BMO Centre, and tons of top notch restaurants in and around the beltline.  Clean and comfortable place, would recommend and the owner friendly, helpful and prompt to reply if any issues or questions arise.",

It\u2019s the perfect location for day trips as well. If you\u2019re a light sleeper bring some earplugs for the weekends. The rest of the week was fine. We loved our stay in Calgary. It\u2019s a beautiful city.",

I would gladly stay at this or any other spaces they are hosts of after this experience and recommend others do as well.",

Tristan is an accessible host providing detailed instructions, information and checking in to answer any questions.",

Indoor parking is a nice feature for security and in the winter weather.",

Unit was comfortable with a very good kitchen set-up. Only negative was that the unit didn't have great lighting but I guess most guests are not coming for an end of November stay.",

The hosts were also great communicators. I appreciated that the space accommodated for little ones (e.g. kiddie cups, socket covers, pack n play).

      "Location was ideal for our appointments downtown. The place was smaller than we thought but still comfortable. Since I am somewhat of a neat freak, I did notice a few places that could have a quick wipe down and better attention to small repairs. The space was more on the warm side. Open windows during the night helped. Clear communication with host. Overall a good stay!",
      "Good cozy spot with everything you need for a stay. Very clean and lots of restaurants around. Host was very nice just a little hard to get a hold of leading up to check in but overall a good experience.",
      "Very lovely place to stay and in a great location! Had no issues: check-in was easy, home was clean, and the place had great amenities. Honestly I'd love to stay here every time I come to Calgary haha. Thanks again Emily!",
      "In a really nice part of Calgary - good bars and restaurants close by and a reasonably short walk to the centre of town. The apartment was quiet and very airy in the quite warm weather. Because it's a corner apartment, when the windows are open the breeze really blows through. The balcony and walk in closet also make the apartment feel spacious. Basement car parking is a big plus too. Would not hesitate to return when we are next in Calgary.",
      "Overall, it was a really great stay! The property was as described and in a really great neighbourhood, especially if you like Asian cuisine. However, the air conditioning was not working. Luckily it wasn't during a heat wave, but we would have appreciated a heads-up so we can make adjustments to our travel. Thanks for the great stay!",
      "We have stayed in this building before because of its amazing location. It's walkable to the stampede grounds and the amazing strip of restaurants just a couple blocks away. We loved Emily's place - super clean, amenities as described, and the portable A/C worked well enough to keep it reasonable in the place on a 30+C day. Thanks for the great stay Emily!",
      "This is a perfect place if you want to get a taste of downtown life with a bit of privacy. Extremely close to many restaurants and bars on 4th St or 17th Ave, and very walkable in all directions. The home has everything you would need and hosts were quick and responsive, and provided what the average traveler may need. Calgary was a wonderful place to visit and this was the perfect spot to base out of for the trip.",
      "This was my second time at this place and once again, everything was perfect! The apartment is great clean, comfortable, and exactly like the photos. Communication with Emily is always easy and pleasant.",

      "Great location! Really enjoyed staying here as it was walkable to all of our destinations. I should have read the listing more thoroughly as the parking garage has a 6ft height limit so I was unable to park underground which is a large part of the reason I booked this location. Other than that the host was very responsive and the place had everything I needed.",

      "Loved this place! Gorgeous view, SUPER comfy sofa, comfy bed, and very nice patio with a little fireplace. The ambiance was wonderful, it really felt like home. The minimal decor is wonderful, has all the utensils you need as well as cooking and baking materials. We forgot something after checkout and they were quickly responsive and accommodating, and we got our forgotten item back even though it added extra steps for them. We would definitely stay here again.",

      "Taylor is always responsive. I texted him for questions at night and early morning for the temperature/ other issues, he always replies & solve it within minutes. Third floor room is tiny so I don\u2019t recommend big luggage on that floor.<br/>The neighbourhood is very walkable. The instructions are clear and easy access.",
      "Lovely townhouse in Beltline, walkable to core downtown, on-street parking was readily available. Two nice bedrooms and spacious kitchen and living room. It had all the amenities that were expected and required.<br/>The Sheldon M. Chumir Health Centre is close - expect the occasional ambulance driving by.",
      "The location was awesome and the instructions were easy to follow<br/>They had no more coffee and when I told the host they apologized and brought some right away even though I didn't mind going to Tim's <br/>That was awesome of them<br/>I would not hesitate to go back there if I return to Calgary",
      "We very much enjoyed our stay here. It is in a walkable area to many restaurants. The host team was responsive and polite. Most importantly, the place was very clean! Highly recommend!",
      "Great place to stay, very nicely maintained and Taylor & Geoff are excellent hosts.  Everything was clear and well communicated, would recommend their place to anyone looking for a downtown location to enjoy Calgary.",
      "Taylor was friendly and responsive, and the place was spacious and as described. The location is perfect, being downtown, which makes restaurants and numerous grocery stores accessible on foot. I cannot recommend Taylor's place enough!",
      "Beautiful airbnb! Super clean and spacious! The location is a short walkable distance from lots of stores and restaurants. The host was extremely responsive and proactive of the comfort of their guest. I felt like they definitely take the time to ensure their place feels like a second home for all their guest. Highly recommend booking this place.",

      "The place was exactly as described. we had a toddler and there were toys and toddler plates which was nice. it was also easy to find parking on the street. the host was very responsive.",
      "Taylor\u2019s place was quite quaint and cozy!  The apartment is very clean. The bedrooms are a bit on the small size, making them slightly difficult to maneuver around, especially at night. The complimentary earplugs were a convenient touch, but we didn\u2019t find that we needed them (thankfully). Shower heads sit too low in both showers. The front entrance is shared by two suites, including this one. Location is downtown, making parking at times very difficult (although free, if you\u2019re able to get into the correct spot). Overall, a good stay!",
      "We had a great stay at Taylor and Geoff\u2019s place. They were very responsive and helpful! Check out their pub, Bottlescrew Bill\u2019s. It was excellent!<br/>Thank you Taylor and Geoff for everything!",

Walking distance to restaurants and decent hangout spots in the Calgary downtown. Would definitely book again!",
      "This was a great find in Calgary. The hosts were responsive and gave very clear instructions. It was comfortable and felt like home. I would stay here again.  They have ear plugs if needed, however I stayed in the upstairs bedroom and I didn\u2019t hear any outside sounds. The hosts also made sure we knew where to park so we wouldn\u2019t get a ticket. There is a fun wall in the hallway when you enter so that you can sign your name. The wifi worked great."

      "In general, our stay was really good! We loved the place and especially the location. The only downside was that the toilet wasn\u2019t working the first night we arrived, so we had to manage until the next morning. Thankfully, it was fixed right away and we were compensated for the inconvenience. Overall, everything else was great\u2014if I were to come back a second time, I\u2019d definitely give it 5 stars!",
      "The couch is very dirty with visible stains , one will think twice before sitting on it, washroom didn\u2019t have enough supplies - shower gel bottle was almost empty, bed sheets were smelly not sure if they were washed or not. View from the condo is nice - the only good thing about this place. Maintenance required - master bedroom closet door doesn\u2019t close properly .",
      "Overall we had a great stay. It was during prime stampede time and for that, the location was perfectly located. Beautiful view and Neil was a great host. Super easy check in, and he was always responsive. The Air Conditioning wasn\u2019t great and it got fairly hot in the condo however we didn\u2019t spend a whole lot of time inside. Little bit of wear and tear from past guests but overall fairly close to the pictures/description.",
      "This is a great condo in a excellent location.  Lots of restaurants and things to do in walkable distance.  A few minor repairs are necessary but nothing that would hamper anyone\u2019s stay.  The view at night is great.  Hosts are easy to reach and access instructions were straightforward and simple.  Thanks for a great stay.",
      "The place is a good size, big enough for four adults. It has a stunning view of downtown at night and in a great location. Walking distance to great food and bars. <br/>Bonus parking included in a garage. <br/>Neighborhood felt safe as did the apartment complex. <br/>Highly recommend.",
      "Nice, responsive host, great view, nice central location, free parking, and close to Stampede.<br/>Unit in need of major repairs. Toilet flush button broke, terrible towels, pillows and linens, no ice maker or ice trays, felt dirty, limited kitchen ware and supplies, broken closet doors, bed footboard broken, rusted shower rod and bad shower curtain, very confusing instructions and difficult to get in and out of building and garage. Host is friendly but this unit needs work.",
      "beautiful skyline view. However, the suite had so many broken furniture peices including the toilet. The floors where not cleaned as the bottoms of our feet were black after walking around barefoot. Neil was great at communicating. I just dont believe the price was worth the suite.",
      "It is very welcoming and beautiful place. Location is easy to find. The view is pretty at night. All the necessities are around the corner. It felt like home and peaceful.",
      "The place is strategically located and almost near to everything. The place has the magnificent view of the downtown skyline. It is an ideal place to explore the city. It has  work stations/ tables.",
      "Such a wonderful place and the view from the apartment is just Wow! Very clean place, private, safe, quiet and everything you need in the kitchen! it's right in downtown, easy walkable to everything and restaurants nearby! Neil and co-hosts are friendly, provided clear instructions for check-in which was easy to follow, and responded quickly to our questions! We would 100% reserve again next time we visit Calgary! Thanks Neil!",
      "I enjoyed the stay of six days. I did not spend much time locally due to busy schedule, but there seemed to be plenty of restaurants nearby. What really stood out in the place was the amazing view towards downtown from the 19th floor. I have stayed in many AirBnBs with nice views but this one took the price. The place was nice and had everything I needed.",
      "The view from the suite is breathtaking ! The floor to ceiling windows gives one a Birds eye view of the Calgary skyline .The location is perfect for all your downtown needs / the amenities in the area are first class / there are an umber of good pubs and restaurants within walking distance - I loved my stay and would return again",
      "Great place, easy to find, stress free parking. Will book again!",
      "Neil was a fantastic host! Was very quick at responding and loved the location! Will definitely come again!",
      "Nice place very well located. The view is quite beautiful, especially at night when the lights come out. Very close to downtown shopping and nightlife.",

      "Neil was amazing and easy to communicate with<br/>The place was beautiful and felt so comfortable there",
      "Was a great place downtown to spend the weekend. Surprised my girlfriend with the view and she absolutely loved it. I would recommend to anyone need a wonderful place to stay downtown",
      "Found an open condom wrapper from what I assume previous guest, and host just ignored me when I tried to<br/>talk about it. Which is a shame because the apartment was nice and had a great view.",
      "Great place with great view. Very neat and well organized. Everything was easy to follow .<br/>Neil was very accomodating and responsive. Definitely recommend if visiting Calgary!",
      "I had a great stay as the location was incredibly convenient to where I needed to be.  When you walk outside at street level, there are a myriad of great options for dining! A fe w items that could benefit from maintenance, but nothing that impacted the stay. Would totally stay here again!",
      "Beautiful place with a perfect view of the city, clean and safe, an excellent experience, we loved it. Neil very attentive and willing to help, thank you very much for everything",
      "I would recommend this place to anyone needing a spot in downtown Calgary! This is the best Airbnb we have found in Calgary by far! The hosts are great, and the place is great as well! We will definitely be trying to book this airbnb every time we are back!"

      "Perfect location, close to downtown but quiet and safe neighbourhood. The host responded super fast and was very helpful! The place was exactly the same as described on the website and clean! Highly recommend :)",
      "Absolute amazing stay, the apartment was incredibly clean and well supplied with all materials for cooking utensils and cleaning products. The hosts were so kind and let us come in earlier to settle in nicely. We really enjoyed our time with Naomi and will definitely be coming back again, it was such a perfect location to enjoy calgery especially when going to the stampede!!",
      "We were so lucky to find this place during the stampede! Clean, great quiet neighbourhood, and really spacious and comfortable. Naomi and team were super helpful and responsive, would definitely stay here again!",
      "The entire experience was very good.  I was anxious to have an ideal place to stay overnight with my brother on a family visit to Calgary. Finding this apartment seemed perfect and the communication with all 3 contacts was prompt and informative. As a result we had a brilliant time in the city knowing we had a ce trsl and perfect apartment to return to. It was also very fairly priced when compared with other apartments on AirBnB. I'd have no hesitation using again and would recommend to anyone seeking accommodation in central calgary",
      "A fantastic spot to stay in downtown Calgary. Clean, comfortable, nicely decorated and has everything you need. Great location that is easily walkable to restaurants, stores, parks and attractions. Nice neighbourhood, and good outdoor parking lot that was easy to use. Building was clean and quiet.  Host is responsive, friendly and provides easy-to-follow instructions. Much better value than nearby hotels  Would definitely stay here again. Thanks for a great stay.",
      "Pretty nice place,Super clean , and a great Location ,  i aslo forget the keys in the apartment Very late night and Naomi answered me quickly to buzz me in.  I recommend \ud83d\udc4c",
      "We stayed in Naomi\u2019s place for a month for work in Calgary. Great location, very safe and comfortable neighborhood. Will definitely stay again!",
      "It was about 15minutes away by walk to go to the main downtown so it was convenient  to access stores, restaurants. <br/>The area was peaceful and quiet so I liked it. <br/>Also I stayed here with my cats, there were most of amenities I needed so I didn't have to buy anything to stay at first except food.<br/>And she checked if I need any help or have any problem.",
      "Comfortable place to unwind or walkable to all the bars and restaurants.  Bed was nice and soft with black out curtains.",
      "With a great location, Naomi's put us where we wanted to be for our stay in Calgary. The apartment was clean except for a couple oversights from the cleaners but it didn't affect our stay. The welcome goodies were a nice touch and appreciated. The bathroom was clean although make sure you like a high pressure shower before you get in! Our only downsides to our stay was the second bedroom bed and the flooring in the main part of the house; which Naomi was happy to address both things when we spoke privately and they are aiming to fix these things for future guests. The bed in the second room was a very hard squeaky mattress and unfortunately that was the downside in our stay as my husband and I couldn't stay together on it. The floors need some repairs as some tiles were broken and loose, but Naomi let me know they are working on getting them fixed which can be appreciated. Naomi's response time was quick and professional. We will be back to stay in the future with the changes made.",
      "Would definitely stay here again on a return trip to Calgary. In great downtown area close to grocery stores, bakeries, restaurants and shopping.",
      "Naomi was very friendly, and made sure we had everything we needed. She even left us with some goodies.",
      "Stayed for two nights, mixed experience. Nice aesthetics but lacks some basic needs. Hosts are friendly and helpful. They were communicative and also arranged a fan upon request, though we had to sleep in about 25-30 degrees on the first night.<br/>Parking instructions are quite confusing, we kept second doubting until the host confirmed (this could be easily resolved with attaching a picture and annotating it). <br/>Internet pretty slow for WFH.<br/>No kitchen paper towels provided. <br/>Most pots and pans don\u2019t have lids. <br/>Only 2-3 dishwasher pods were given and kept in the open near the sink, they all got moist and stuck together. <br/>Black and dark blue towels are provided, which is inappropriate, you can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s clean, white is a standard for a reason. <br/>Bathtub has dark shower curtains and there\u2019s no light in the shower area.<br/>Toiletries (shampoo and all) are poured into glass bottles, you don\u2019t know what you are using on your body.<br/>Hope this helps the host and guests:)",
      "The flat is really nice and quite big, within walking distance from the city centre and various food options.",
      "Naomi's place is so cozy!! You can't get any better for location, anything you could possibly need is only a few blocks away. Great host! I will be definitely booking a return stay next time I'm in town.",
      "Easy and convenient. Clean and lovely!",
      "great place and location and great hoste",
      "It's a perfect place to enjoy the steam.<br/>It was an accommodation. Not only that, but the downtown was also within walking distance, so it was convenient and nice. The kitchen and bathroom were clean and the interior was well done. The bed was comfortable, so I was able to sleep well. If I come back to Calgary, I think I'll definitely come back to this place.",
      "Great location, nice large space, very clean. Would definitely stay here again!",
      "Great accommodation to end our stay! Super cozy comfortable beds, super sofa for a relaxing evening, very quiet outside with beautiful views of the city, not far from the city center and the 17th, nice street for bars and restaurants hehe <br/>We are delighted with our last days in Calgary!",
      "Everything worked out well and I felt very comfortable right away. The apartment is very cozy, the area is very quiet and there are great restaurants nearby! I could reach everything quickly by bus and also on foot. I had a good time and would come back!",
      "We enjoyed our stay!",
      "Great location, central yet quiet, nice apartment for our family with 2 children",
      "Quiet area close to center The apartment is suitable for groups of friends or family."

Finding this apartment seemed perfect and the communication with all 3 contacts was prompt and informative. As a result we had a brilliant time in the city knowing we had a ce trsl and perfect apartment to return to. It was also very fairly priced when compared with other apartments on AirBnB. I'd have no hesitation using again and would recommend to anyone seeking accommodation in central calgary",

The apartment was clean except for a couple oversights from the cleaners but it didn't affect our stay. The welcome goodies were a nice touch and appreciated. The bathroom was clean although make sure you like a high pressure shower before you get in! Our only downsides to our stay was the second bedroom bed and the flooring in the main part of the house; which Naomi was happy to address both things when we spoke privately and they are aiming to fix these things for future guests. The bed in the second room was a very hard squeaky mattress and unfortunately that was the downside in our stay as my husband and I couldn't stay together on it. The floors need some repairs as some tiles were broken and loose, but Naomi let me know they are working on getting them fixed which can be appreciated. Naomi's response time was quick and professional. We will be back to stay in the future with the changes made.",

        "review": "Stayed for two nights, mixed experience. Nice aesthetics but lacks some basic needs. Hosts are friendly and helpful. They were communicative and also arranged a fan upon request, though we had to sleep in about 25-30 degrees on the first night.<br/>Parking instructions are quite confusing, we kept second doubting until the host confirmed (this could be easily resolved with attaching a picture and annotating it). <br/>Internet pretty slow for WFH.<br/>No kitchen paper towels provided. <br/>Most pots and pans don\u2019t have lids. <br/>Only 2-3 dishwasher pods were given and kept in the open near the sink, they all got moist and stuck together. <br/>Black and dark blue towels are provided, which is inappropriate, you can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s clean, white is a standard for a reason. <br/>Bathtub has dark shower curtains and there\u2019s no light in the shower area.<br/>Toiletries (shampoo and all) are poured into glass bottles, you don\u2019t know what you are using on your body.<br/>Hope this helps the host and guests:)",
        "host_response": "Thank you for your feedback Anikesh. <br/>the condo is in a concrete building that stays naturally cool and cools quickly with fans. As stated in the listing, there is no AC, which is common in Calgary. <br/>We use black and navy towels for their quality and durability, and all linens are professionally laundered. Soaps and shampoos are provided in clearly labeled glass bottles as part of our eco-conscious approach. We only provide quality products.<br/>Our cleaning care team follows the highest standards, and we pride ourselves on offering a spotless, well-equipped space. <br/>Unfortunately, this guest left the unit dirty, left balcony doors open, and did not follow checkout instructions, creating safety and cleanliness concerns.<br/>We remain committed to delivering a high-quality experience for respectful guests."

      "Booked this BnB for a nice quiet gateway. The room was not so clean, had debris and dirt over the floors. The view was the only outstanding part of the apartment. We hardly got any sleep in due to the party happening. The closest was pre-broken when we got to the bnb, definitely does not match the pictures. I wouldn\u2019t book again if I was looking for comfort. I will definitely book for the view. The communication between the host was smooth.",
      "I had a fantastic stay here. The location is amazing - clear views of the Calgary tower from all areas of the condo. <br/>The unit was clean, and communication from the hosts was very warm and near instant throughout the experience, which took a lot of stress off of the trip. <br/>Kudos to the team, I enjoyed my stay and will be back. <br/>Thanks again!",

      "Pros... there are many:<br/>Best thing about this place is the full view of the city from both the lounge and the bedroom - I couldn't get enough of it!<br/>Place is much as pictured, photos are glossier and make it seem a bit bigger/ brighter. It's still a beautiful place, even without the gloss.<br/>Check in was simple and contactless.<br/>Everything was clean<br/>Appreciated the Tim Hortons coffee pods every morning :)<br/>Nice Japanese restaurant/ bento place nearby, and a convenient walk/ ride to Stephen Avenue. <br/>Bed was very comfy, and there's loads of storage space.<br/>-Shower head - please replace asap as that one is unusable - used the bottom tap which was frustrating.<br/>- Soap dispenser - pump did not work throughout my stay<br/>- Some sockets in bedroom don't work<br/>- Not a major issue for me, but  bedroom closet door is broken and leans on a wall<br/>-Communication was prompt, except near check-out; requested delayed check out and had to follow up next day. Declined, so had to leave sharpish!",

It's still a beautiful place, even without the gloss.<br/>Check in was simple and contactless.<br/>Everything was clean<br/>Appreciated the Tim Hortons coffee pods every morning :)<br/>Nice Japanese restaurant/ bento place nearby, and a convenient walk/ ride to Stephen Avenue. <br/>Bed was very comfy, and there's loads of storage space.<br/>-Shower head - please replace asap as that one is unusable - used the bottom tap which was frustrating.<br/>- Soap dispenser - pump did not work throughout my stay<br/>- Some sockets in bedroom don't work<br/>- Not a major issue for me, but  bedroom closet door is broken and leans on a wall<br/>-Communication was prompt, except near check-out; requested delayed check out and had to follow up next day. Declined, so had to leave sharpish!",

      "I received very specific instructions before my trip and what to expect. The front door wasn\u2019t opening as described in the instructions. However, I messaged the host and they responded right away. The other tenants were quiet. The balcony had a great view. Very easy to get in and out of the building and the suite. Extremely satisfied with my stay. 100% would stay here again.",
      "I had a great stay! The host provided very clear instructions about everything, which made check-in and navigating the place super easy. The apartment was clean, well-maintained, and equipped with everything I needed for a comfortable stay. The only slight downside was the nearby trains, but it wasn\u2019t a big issue for me. Overall, a very positive experience and I\u2019d happily stay again!",
      "The elevator and entrance system can be a bit tedious, but as long as you carefully follow the instructions, it\u2019s totally fine! Everything was great \u2014 clean, exactly as described, and the view was really nice! I highly recommend Troy & this place.",
      "This was a comfortable, well-equipped apartment for my stay of 8 nights. I found the instructions clear and easy to follow and Troy responded to me when I had a couple of questions.",
      "We really enjoyed our stay! The apartment was nice and had everything we needed. The view from the balcony was beautiful, and the location was perfect. As it\u2019s in the downtown area, it can be a bit noisy at times, but it wasn\u2019t too bad and didn\u2019t affect our stay. Overall, a great place to stay!",
      "Lovely apartment in the centre of town very close to bars and restaurants. <br/>Plenty of space in the apartment to cook your own food and get a bit of peace from the busy city. <br/>Check in and check out was very clear too. <br/>Highly recommend over a hotel stay in the city!",
      "The location is close to so much, lots of restaurants, convenient stores, a fun Ukrainian night club across the street that had fun people & good food. The place was clean, the pool was nice as well as the gym. 10/10 recommended and I will be coming back for sure :)",
      "The apartment was clean and nice, the location is great, but take in mind that it\u2019s downtown so it might get a bit noisy. It was nice having all the kitchenware so we could also make our own food.",
      "Overall the place is excellent and Troy is great to deal with, and not just because we share the same name, lol.  The entry system at the front door and the initial entry before you get the key fob inside the suite is very difficult and doesn\u2019t work well. There are alternative entrance instructions for later at night and I just simply used those even though it was during the day. I was able to enter from the Parkade. Minor in the big picture. I learned later the problem with the front intercom is quite well known and widespread; not the fault of the owner.",
      "Troy\u2019s place was great. We loved the 28th floor view of the city. The balcony was a great feature. Everything was super clean and very high quality. Would stay here again in a heartbeat.",
      "Fantastic location with beautiful view! Walking distance to so much in downtown Calgary. Troy was also extremely friendly, responsive and welcoming. Book this place it will not disappoint!",
      "Loved staying at this spot! Needed a quick stay for an easy drive to the airport after visiting Banff! It was perfect, super clean, amazing views and comfortable furniture. Would 10/10 recommend",
      "A convenient location for those visiting Calgary. Clean , compact space great for a short stay as a couple or a extended stay as one person.",
      "Great place. Would stay again. Super easy clear check in and check out. Building amenities were a nice bonus.",
      "Stayed in Calgary for about 48 hours to visit Banff so I just need a space to crash. Perfect spot for the price. Very clean, nice view from the balcony, easy check in. The neighborhood just seemed a bit sketchy but that could just be me. Other than that it was everything I needed for a short stay. Would stay here again.",
      "I had a great experience with Airbnb! The place was exactly as described\u2014clean, cozy, and in a great location. Troy provided detailed instructions, making check-in and check-out very easy, even without meeting in person. Communication was clear and quick, which made my stay smooth and comfortable. I highly recommend this place to others!",
      "Exactly as described, and in a great location! Perfect for our 4 day trip in Calgary",
      "Great place to stay! Clean, convenient location. Close to lots of things.",
      "Great location, walking distance to the events I had planned and good dinning as well from breakfast & dinner. Highly recommend if you enjoy the downtown atmosphere .",
      "We had a short stay, but the apartment was clean and nicely decorated. The view from the balcony was an added bonus. Overall enjoyed our stay.",
      "Wonderful Stay!!!! Beautiful balcony views of the city skyline, so so nice at nighttime!! Definitely worth what you pay, such a great deal!! Would definitely stay again!",
      "The place was great! We were here for the Rotary Convention and it was very convenient to the BMO Center and Scotiadome.",
      "The condo is exactly as described. However, the following details were not mentioned: Whether these points are important or not is up to each person:<br/>1. The location in the middle of the city means it is incredibly noisy. There is a freight train railroad line right in front of the house (trains run 24/7). On weekends, loud gas-guzzling car enthusiasts roam the streets. This means that the condo's biggest advantage is also its biggest disadvantage.<br/>2. You can hear the ventilation from the hallway in the apartment.<br/>3. There is hardly any storage space in the bedroom. There are no shelves, and only a handful of clothes hangers. You are forced to live out of a suitcase.<br/>4. The bed is max. 1.40 m wide.<br/>5. The blinds barely darken the room. When it gets light outside, the bedroom gets light, too.<br/>6. The cleanliness could be improved.<br/>For those who are less sensitive to noise & light, the condo offers an ideal base from which to explore the city. Unfortunately, not for us.",
      "Thanks for the great stay! Everything was exactly as described / shown in pictures. My sleep was great and I enjoyed waking up to the city sunrise!"

The entry system at the front door and the initial entry before you get the key fob inside the suite is very difficult and doesn\u2019t work well. There are alternative entrance instructions for later at night and I just simply used those even though it was during the day. I was able to enter from the Parkade. Minor in the big picture.

The location in the middle of the city means it is incredibly noisy. There is a freight train railroad line right in front of the house (trains run 24/7). On weekends, loud gas-guzzling car enthusiasts roam the streets. This means that the condo's biggest advantage is also its biggest disadvantage.<br/>2. You can hear the ventilation from the hallway in the apartment.<br/>3. There is hardly any storage space in the bedroom. There are no shelves, and only a handful of clothes hangers. You are forced to live out of a suitcase.<br/>4. The bed is max. 1.40 m wide.<br/>5. The blinds barely darken the room. When it gets light outside, the bedroom gets light, too.<br/>6. The cleanliness could be improved.<br/>For those who are less sensitive to noise & light, the condo offers an ideal base from which to explore the city. Unfortunately, not for us.",

      "Joseph was an amazing host.<br/>This is a great place to stay if you plan to be out all the time and experiencing the neighbourhood.<br/>I was here for a week-long work trip and was in mostly except for my daily meetings. The kitchen is great for bringing in food, but if you\u2019re planning to stay long you\u2019ll need to bring extra cooking supplies, and a coffee maker.",
      "Great location on a busy strip of 17 Ave with loads of bars and restaurants that\u2019s bumping most nights, especially over the weekend. Keep that in mind if you are a light sleeper, there is a decent amount of noise that comes in from outside, but fans in the room can help mask most of it. Apartment itself is very simple and bare-bones in an older building which didn\u2019t affect the stay at all.",
      "Location was great for as we were visiting at the stampede grounds . Very good bed, as for the kitchen we only had  light breakfasts during our stay .  Good spot  & restaurants very convenient.",
      "all around great place to eat and Joseph was a wonderful host. Real quick and easy access to bars and right in the heart of the city so really ideal if you\u2019re travelling through transit. Would definitely stay again if the opportunity arises itself.",
      "Consistently great...!<br/>I am a repeat guest and keep coming back because it\u2019s consistently great. Joseph communicates fast, the home is immaculate, and little touches make it feel easy and welcoming.<br/>Thank you, Joseph, for another great stay.",
      "Unit is quiet and is as advertised. It is close to restaurants, pubs, and coffee shops. Joseph responds quickly. He gave good recommendations for local restaurants and pubs. Would stay again.",
      "We stayed for three nights. Joseph was a fantastic host to deal with. Very responsive and accommodating. Joseph provided us with plenty of local suggestions on places to visit and eat out and was flexible when our plane was delayed and we arrived in two groups instead of one. I highly recommend staying here.",
      "Stayed here for stampede, the location is incredible right on 17th Ave so easy walking distance to the grounds as well as everything 17th has to offer. The unit was clean and comforting, and had a great AC unit in the bedroom. Will definitely stay here again!",
      "Such a convenient place to be if you want to explore down town Calgary! Will definitely be staying again for any future trips! Owner offered great recommendations and their communication was above and beyond! Super helpful and accommodating.",
      "Host is very helpful and friendly, and the unit is definitely worth the price. It\u2019s located in a very convenient and walkable area. The main downside is that the unit isn\u2019t too soundproof; also the bathroom doesn\u2019t have a vent.",
      "Was right on 17th ave which is perfect for a street of pubs & patios.<br/>Had a hiccup with a parking & he responded instantly to give us a new stall number.<br/>Check in was super easy, the place was nice for a couple to stay in. AC in the room made all the difference!",
      "Awesome place to stay, no complaints. The host was always fast to respond when I had questions and were very proactive as well. A place I would definitely come back to.",
      "If you\u2019re looking for a simple, easy and relatively affordable place to stay, this is a solid choice. The unit is almost exactly like the pictures, and its in a great location. The lack of a washer and dryer is a little bit annoying, but other than that and the slightly sticky floors, I have no complaints.",
      "for a last minute deal, and a late late check-in, Joseph  was extremely helpful.",
      "Super friendly, responsible, couple definitely in the future if it\u2019s available for my next trip to Calgary I will be back there thank you so much .",
      "As advertised, great location, really nice restaurants just across the street, within walking distance of all things needed during stampede time",
      "The host was nice and cooperative. Truly a five\u2011star experience -I\u2019d happily stay here again and recommend it to anyone visiting the area!\ud83d\ude0a",
      "Nice place, it's what it looks like in the photos, Joseph all the time attentive. I recommend this place.",
      "Joseph\u2019s home was everything I needed for my stay in Calgary! Location was amazing being right downtown and the included parking spot was so nice. Would definitely stay here again!",
      "Joseph was quick to respond, gave great recommendations, walking distance to great restaurant\u2019s. The apartment was clean and looked just like the pictures. Highly recommend and will stay again when back in Calgary.",
      "I really enjoyed my stay at Joseph\u2019s place - the apartament was clean and had all needed items. Jospeh was a great hosts giving us advices where to eat and what to see, as also he was really helpful.<br/>The only problem would be some noise from the neighbors but this is not really something that the host can maintain himself as it is a apartament in a bigger building.<br/>Additionally I need to add that the bed was amazing and it was hard to leave it in the morning ;)<br/>Thank you aJoseph for a great stay! :)",
      "Excellent location. Clean unit and helpful host.",

Keep that in mind if you are a light sleeper, there is a decent amount of noise that comes in from outside, but fans in the room can help mask most of it. Apartment itself is very simple and bare-bones in an older building which didn\u2019t affect the stay at all.",

      "Place was great. <br/>If I had to say anything, I would say the process of getting the key fob for the garage and the up and down is time consuming.   <br/>Having to add sheets and pillows to the bed was also a minor inconvenience, I\u2019d also prefer to have less of the communication/info via a 3rd party website outside of Airbnb. <br/>But no big deal will 100% stay here again.",

      "Nomadic Vacation Rentals were great, they were friendly and able to respond and help right away.",
      "We were very thankful to find a last minute rental. The location was convenient and the amenities were as listed. We did enjoy the outdoor patio and the beds were comfy. The company was very responsive the multiple times I had to reach out due to poor instructions (how to access the building / apt ) and the remote door lock not working. I also informed them of the bathroom light not working and missing towel rack in the second bathroom for which they were thankful for my messages. I did not have a chance to mention the dirty kitchen and fact that I had to put sheets on the bed, which was not expected especially when arriving at 3 am. I do hope they change this cleaning service and update their entry and garbage instructions. If so this could definitely be a 4 or 5 star.",

I also informed them of the bathroom light not working and missing towel rack in the second bathroom for which they were thankful for my messages. I did not have a chance to mention the dirty kitchen and fact that I had to put sheets on the bed, which was not expected especially when arriving at 3 am. I do hope they change this cleaning service and update their entry and garbage instructions. If so this could definitely be a 4 or 5 star.",

      "Good flat, responsive guest, clean. Only thing, be aware that the flat has wide windows open on the building's main terrace so not ideal if you want full privacy or unobstructed views.",
      "Do not rent from these people!! Place is not clean with stains and mould. But the worst part is that the cleaners \u201ccleaned\u201d the unit a day before my departure, dumped all my clothes, shoes and toiletries bag in my suitcase, threw away my razor and shampoo and stole $300 that I had hiding in my toiletries bag!! Filed a report with Airbnb and the police. No help from the host and calling me a liar even though they admitted that the cleaners made a mistake with \u201ccleaning \u201c the unit a day early. Absolutely furious! I asked for the name of the cleaner, so I can pass it onto the police, but they\u2019re refusing to give it to me. Be aware!!! 11 years on Airbnb, never experienced something like this.",
      "Awesome location! So many restaurants and options close by including a Starbucks right across the street.<br/>Very responsive couple! Easy to follow instructions. The condo felt cozy and nice to have more space than a hotel room. <br/>There were some issues that have been previously discussed. I think also we would\u2019ve liked new towels and a second key.

      "Mary and Joe\u2019s apartment is located in a great place, tons of local amenities including shops, pubs, restaurants, parks and more. <br/>The residence itself had a lot of broken fixtures such as toilet paper holders, closet doors, the towel hook was hanging out of the wall with screws poking out, patio door was broken off. Many of the day to day necessities couldn\u2019t be used which was difficult over a 10 day period.",
      "It was conveniently located in the heart of downtown, making it easy to get around, with plenty of amenities nearby. The place was clean, and the detailed, friendly explanations were much appreciated!",
      "The suite was immaculate, peaceful, and felt like home. It provided  the major things we needed for a comfortable and relaxing stay. The abundant natural light from the surrounding windows was a delight, and I liked the small yard that connected to the larger rooftop garden, which was creatively designed as the roof of the parking area. (Other suits on that floor, adjacent to the yard, had a small yard connecting to that area as well). A couple of minor issues were that the window handle was broken and needed repair, and the towel rack in the bathroom was missing.",
      "This was all about LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION <br/>Large enough for 2 couples or individuals to have their own separate space and yet still feel connected to each other\u2026.. Did I say LOCATION Yet\u2026.!!!",
      "Great location. My group booked for the stampede and everything was within walking distance. However, the place itself needs a lot of maintenance work done (closet doors falling off, towel rack fallen off/holes in wall, patio door doesn\u2019t have handle and screen was on the ground outside).",
      "The apt is in a very good location  with easy access to the train and many good restaurants within walking distance. The accommodation was comfortable and had all amenities for a short stay. The host was extremely responsive and welcoming.<br/>However this apartment needs significant maintenance work. There are numerous broken fittings including the door handle which greets you on first entering. This could be a five star accommodation however the property requires better care and attention."

Filed a report with Airbnb and the police. No help from the host and calling me a liar even though they admitted that the cleaners made a mistake with \u201ccleaning \u201c the unit a day early.

      "The condo was wonderful - top story of the building meant almost no noise from neighbors and nobody above you. The location is amazing - close to several great restaurants and walking distance into the downtown core. Very responsive host and the place was really cozy and as described. Would return next time I'm in Calgary!",
      "The apartment was just as described and shown in the pictures. The apartment had everything that's we needed and more. it's in a great location, within an easy walk of the Calgary Stampede, Scotiabank Saddledome and downtown. Stacey was very responsive and answered all queries quickly and clearly.",
      "A lovely stay in Calgary - Stacey\u2019s instructions were super clear and she was always responsive to messages! The apartment itself was perfect for our 3nights to explore the city and also near to shops and restaurants in mission/17th ave! Thanks so much for hosting us!",
      "Absolutely amazing stay! Such an awesome location, everything was in walking distance and very close to amazing restaurants and bars but still private and peaceful. So friendly and just overall a beautiful space. Will definitely be back :)",
      "Stacey was very responsive to all our questions, especially with our late check-in. The place looks just like the pictures, very clean and in a great location. Everything is easily accessible by walking.  We enjoyed our stay and would stay again next time in Calgary.",
      "Well-appointed is an understatement! This immaculately clean apartment has everything you could possibly need. A very welcome change from the cheap furniture, sparse decor and wafer-thin pillows that have become the norm on this site. This place stands out as you really feel the hosts care about you and your stay. Super comfy bed, is definitely quiet, and being on the top floor there\u2019s no one walking above you. Loved my stay here.",
      "My daughter and I really enjoyed staying at Stacey\u2019s place. Great convenient location with restaurants within walking distance. The place itself was very clean and comfortable and the host was very easy to communicate with and helpful. Also appreciated the host thoughtfulness to little details like leaving plenty of coffee for us, and even bottled water. Definitely recommend to others and would stay here again when in Calgary. \ud83d\ude0a",
      "The condo is very well situated in a great neighbourhood. Very convenient and walkable to downtown. You can find pretty much anything you need in the area.

Thanks Stacey and Jeff! I'll be back for sure.",

I didn\u2019t get to enjoy the amenities in the apartment while I was there but it had everything I needed. My biggest thing when booking a place for work is a comfy bed and a quiet location. This did not disappoint! In fact, I loved the details with multiple pillow options from soft to firm. I slept like a baby. Would absolutely book again!",

I never knew about it. The place was immaculately clean and spacious. It\u2019s walkable to all the great restaurants and stampede. She gave me such good suggestions and was wonderful to engage in dialogue with.  I will definitely stay here next time when I am in Calgary. Thanks a ton Stacy!!",

We appreciate all the extra effort Stacey  went to to ensure we could continue with our stay, we're comfortable and offered additional solutions for us.  The condo and its location (1 block  off 17th), we're perfect for us and even with the little glitch we truly enjoyed our stay.

We look forward to  booking with Jeff and Stacey on our next Calgary visit!",

Very peaceful and just minutes a way from the vibrant city. 10/10 would recommend, and is officially on my radar for any of my stays in Calgary.",
      "The pictures aren\u2019t able to capture how at home this place is. Truly a cozy and comfortable space! Walking distance to anything you\u2019d need in Calgary. Close to all the restaurants and bar. 17th Ave is right around the corner so there\u2019s lots to do. <br/>The host is super responsive and is extremely accommodating!",
      "Jeff and Stacey\u2019s place was super cozy and very clean. It is in an area that is very quiet and secluded from traffic. The location of their place is just walking distance to so many restaurants, stores, cafes, etc. that we hardly had to use our car to get anywhere. It had everything we needed, the washroom was spotless and the bed was very comfortable. Would definitely stay here again for future visits."

We appreciate all the extra effort Stacey  went to to ensure we could continue with our stay, we're comfortable and offered additional solutions for us.  The condo and its location (1 block  off 17th), we're perfect for us and even with the little glitch we truly enjoyed our stay.  The condo was super clean, well stocked for those who want to do some cooking and est in, had coffee already available for guests, and we found the bed very comfortable.   We look forward to  booking with Jeff and Stacey on our next Calgary visit!",

      "We had a wonderful stay at this apartment! The location was perfect \u2014 close to everything downtown and with a great view of the Calgary Tower right from the window. The space fit our family\u2019s needs perfectly, offering plenty of comfort and convenience during our trip. We\u2019d definitely stay here again on our next visit to Calgary!",
      "This unit was very cozy and modern. The only downside was that there were homeless people lying on the grass in the building area, which made it feel unsafe to walk at night. It's a bit concerning. One of the best was, they have an Italian restaurant in the building that serves super delicious food, which made my daughter's birthday more special.",
      "We loved staying at this apartment! The location couldn\u2019t be more central, right in the heart of downtown Calgary, within walking distance to great restaurants, caf\u00e9s, shopping, and key attractions. Being able to step outside and immediately be in the middle of everything was such a bonus.",
      "We had a great stay! The place was very clean, and check-in was super easy. The view from the unit was beautiful, and we really enjoyed the swimming pool and gym facilities. The beds were comfy, and the location was perfect, close to everything we needed. The only minor inconvenience was the parking, which was on the 5th floor of the underground lot. A bit of a hassle, but honestly, not a big deal. Top of all, the instruction was super clear and consistent communication from the host made our check-in and out super easy. Would definitely stay here again!",
      "I had a delightful experience at Misbah & Zubi\u2019s place! The apartment was spotless and well equipped with everything we needed for a comfortable stay. <br/>Location wise, it couldn\u2019t have been better. The property is just a short walk close to restaurant and shops. We loved being able to explore the area easily. <br/>Misbah & Zubi were incredibly responsive and helpful. Checking in and out was seamless, which we really appreciated. <br/>I highly recommend this place and would definitely stay here again on my next visit! Thank you, Misbah & Zubi for a wonderful experience!",
      "Was a great place to stay! <br/>Great hosts. Very responsive. Place was clean and perfect for our family of 5.<br/>Thank you for providing a playard for our little one!<br/>A lot of nice restaurants just walking distance away.<br/>10 minute drive from Telus Spark and the Calgary Zoo.<br/>Great view of the city",
      "Overall great stay and a wonderful location. There is a ton of things to do right within walking distance. The apartment is well furnished and has everything you would need for a few nights. A couple things I would like to know if I were looking at booking: the pool is tiny- you will not be swimming, more like a large hot tub. Additionally, the check in requires a buzzer answer from the hosts, so if you are coming in late, make sure you let them know that. I would definitely stay here again though, just fyi.",
      "It's a bit tricky to access the suite, but once inside it's a great apartment in a centrally located area of Calgary.  <br/>It is a bit lacking in terms of cutlery.  And the patio door and the bathroom door didn't lock (faulty).  On the plus side, Misbah and Zubi offered to send someone over during our stay to look at them.  We declined.<br/>The balcony was filthy and the bathroom floor had some accumulated dirt around the toilet, which I cleaned myself. There was lots of dust under the bed. Again, Misbah and Zubi responded well to my concerns... immediately sending a $50 rebate.",
      "My family and I had a great time! Beautiful place and very clean! The host were so nice, very friendly and helpful. Would definitely recommend",
      "The place was as described, the hosts were friendly. They had very detailed and clear instructions for checking in and out.",
      "A very comfortable apartment in downtown Calgary. Easy walking distance to supermarket and restaurants. The hosts were attentive and responsive. Highly recommended.",
      "The host was responsive and the location is very central with lots to do within walking distance. Overall it was a nice experience.",
      "The pictures are deceiving in terms of upkeep and cleanliness. Everything felt sticky. The cleaning rags reeked of vinegar, and, being sticky, had obviously not been washed. All the glass was filthy, and some of the bedding smelled. There were not enough towels, and I couldn\u2019t wait to get home and take a shower in my own home.<br/>When I contacted the host twice with questions, instead of answering them, he would ask, \u201cHave you read the information package?\u201d It was incredibly rude and unhelpful, especially during check-in when my hands are full of luggage and I have two small children with me. <br/>I\u2019m quite sure we left the place cleaner than it was when we arrived. <br/>Good location, poor hosting.",
      "Misbah and Zubi were great hosts and helped any issues we had",
      "We really enjoyed our stay! It had everything we needed, great location, & the hosts were very thorough and kind. <br/>Would stay here again.",

      "Great host, responsive, helpful, great location and apartment. Would definitely stay again.",
      "We had a lovely stay. Misbah and Zubi were very helpful and friendly, which made our visit that much more pleasant.",
      "Misbah and Zubi\u2019s place is amazing! The communication was smooth and everything was perfect.",
      "The place was clean, nicely decorated, and with great views. The hosts were very flexible with the check-in & check-out process. I needed some kitchen items, and they provided them right away. They were very responsive. Overall, great experience.",
      "Thank you so much for hosting us in your beautiful home! It was even more stunning in person than in the pictures. The check-in process was seamless thanks to your detailed and thoughtful instructions. The place was spotless, cozy, and had everything we needed. We especially loved the breathtaking view, it truly made our stay special. There was also so much to do around the area, we were never bored. Highly recommend this stay to anyone visiting the area!",
      "Perfect spot for doing limited time shows and work in Calgary, it was our perfect space to rest and relax in. My favourite thing was the view each morning when we had beautiful sunrise. Be aware you are in the heart of the city, so you can hear it all around. I will say our hosts are extremely responsive, we never got stuck or lost during our stay. The place was really nice and absolutely perfect for the four of us. Thank you Misbah and Zubi, for being great hosts.",
      "We had a very good stay at Misbah\u2019s and Zubi\u2019s place. We checked in very late because of late arrival of our plane in Calgary and our hosts were there to help us check-in smoothly. <br/>The flat is true to pictures: very comfy, with nice furniture and <br/>gorgeous views on the Calgary Tower on one side and the Rockies on the other one.<br/>Supermarket is a 5 minutes walk away. City centre 10 min.  The area is really safe even in the evening. <br/>Thank you Misbah and Zubi for this great stay ! We will definitely book your flat again next time we are in Calgary \ud83d\ude0a",

The apartment is well furnished and has everything you would need for a few nights. A couple things I would like to know if I were looking at booking: the pool is tiny- you will not be swimming, more like a large hot tub. Additionally, the check in requires a buzzer answer from the hosts, so if you are coming in late, make sure you let them know that. I would definitely stay here again though, just fyi.",

It was just like the photos and the host was attentive, quick to respond and helpful in answering any questions. Regarding the price, it was a little bit expensive for the size of the space, but worth it for the location. I would definitely recommend booking with these hosts!",

      "Had a wonderful stay. Felt right at home and was a lovely introduction to Calgary - would definitely return/recommend.",
      "Overall I had a wonderful stay! I\u2019ve stayed in this building numerous times and it\u2019s close to everything I love. <br/>The only two things I would change about the airbnb is to have blackout blinds in the bedroom. There are blackout ones in the living room, which I was a tad confused by. It was hard to sleep in after the sun came up. <br/>Also, I\u2019ve never had a checkout time be 10am. It\u2019s usually 11 or 12. So I was a bit rushed in the morning and had to go around downtown with my luggage due to a later flight.<br/>With that being said I would definitely stay here again. <br/>The bed was so big and comfortable, I was missing sugar for my coffee and Kyle had some delivered which I appreciated a lot.<br/>I\u2019m 100% coming back and will be booking through this host for sure.<br/>Thank you!!",

I\u2019ve stayed in this building numerous times and it\u2019s close to everything I love. <br/>The only two things I would change about the airbnb is to have blackout blinds in the bedroom. There are blackout ones in the living room, which I was a tad confused by. It was hard to sleep in after the sun came up. <br/>Also, I\u2019ve never had a checkout time be 10am. It\u2019s usually 11 or 12. So I was a bit rushed in the morning and had to go around downtown with my luggage due to a later flight.<br/>With that being said I would definitely stay here again. <br/>The bed was so big and comfortable, I was missing sugar for my coffee and Kyle had some delivered which I appreciated a lot.<br/>I\u2019m 100% coming back and will be booking through this host for sure.<br/>Thank you!!",

The unit has a noise detector and it shows the noise level was less than 45 db during the night on July 10-July 11,  so this is a lie. Moreover, all Stampede activity ends at 11.30 pm.  You also should know If anybody makes a noise after 11 pm you can call police or you can just notify me and I will the rest. The parking spot matches the standard size approved  by city. My guests sometimes parks big tracks there and you are the first guest who complained on it. I am just wondering what kind of vehicle you tried to park there"

      "This is a great place.   We enjoyed our stay. The view of the Calgary Tower at night was wonderful.  Great walking distance for local attractions, restaurants, coffee shops and more. Easy to access by car or Uber.  Condo was clean and comfortable.",
      "Hosts were very responsive to messages. The place was clean and comfortable. It looked as advertised and location seemed good! Always a bonus to have a dedicated parking spot available as street parking in the area looked very busy, so was thankful for that.",
      "Amazing stay! Right in the heart of downtown \u2014walking distance to everything. The condo was spotless, modern, and so comfortable. The hosts were fantastic and made everything effortless. We can\u2019t wait to come back!",
      "The place has an excellent location and communication with the host is very good. They were always attentive and ready to answer my questions.<br/>Something to keep in mind: if, for any reason, you arrive after 11 PM, there\u2019s a $50 fee for late check-in. So if you have a night flight, consider this, as check-in is not 100% self-service.",
      "We had a wonderful stay, everything looked the same as in the photos and we enjoyed the amazing view. The place was clean and has all the necessities. The location is convenient as it is in the heart of downtown Calgary, with lots of restaurants around.<br/>The hosts were very clear in providing instructions and very responsive. Will definitely stay here again next time.",
      "The location is great. Not too far and not too close from upper downtown where we spent most of our time.<br/>However, with the windows closed, it is really calm in the apartment.<br/>On the opposite side, the entrance door is not soundproof and if your neighbors do not respect the building rules in the middle of the night, you'll hear them!<br/>Everything was as described and even better than expected. But there is one thing that could be annoying for people sleeping on the convertible sofa or in the primary bedroom: there are filtering curtains in the bedroom and in the living room except on the balcony glass door. Since the primary bedroom sliding doors are made of frosted glass, it lets light through somehow.<br/>Overall, the stay was good.",
      "The only thing I didn't like was the check in, as I arrived in the early hours of the morning because my flight was delayed. There should be something easier to access, regardless of the time you arrive. I paid $50 for this. Other than that, everything is ok.",
      "Overall our stay was good. The apartment was very clean & had a nice layout. To enhance people\u2019s stays they could definitely clean & add furniture to the balcony for summer the months.",
      "Great location. This Airbnb had everything that was stated in listing. The AC would not cool to set temperature. So it got uncomfortably hot at times. Overall cute clean nice apartment.",
      "We had an absolutely delightful stay. The property looked exactly like the photos\u2014no surprises\u2014and the stunning view made our experience even more enjoyable.<br/>The location couldn\u2019t have been better\u2014it\u2019s right in the heart of downtown Calgary, surrounded by a wide variety of restaurants and attractions, making it incredibly convenient for getting around and exploring the city.<br/>The hosts were excellent\u2014communication was clear and timely from start to finish. I\u2019m already looking forward to staying here again the next time I\u2019m in Calgary.",
      "Excellent location, clean, nice decor and very responsive hosts. Would definitely stay here again!",
      "Place is clean and location is good. Late night check in is a bit tricky. Second bedroom does not have window. Otherwise it is good.",
      "Too much dust everywhere, it\u2019s supposed to be 6 person max. But couch bed not okay for 2 people\u2019s. But there is extra pillow & bed sheets was available",
      "I had a great stay at this Airbnb! The check-in process was seamless and super easy, which made everything stress-free from the start. The location was great\u2014close to restaurants and walking distance to downtown.  The view from the place was absolutely stunning! There was no iron or ironing board but when I requested one they were quick to provide it. Great stay, highly recommend!",
      "I had an amazing stay at this beautiful downtown Airbnb! The downtown view was absolutely stunning, and the location made it easy to explore nearby restaurants and attractions. The hosts were responsive and thoughtful, ensuring a comfortable and enjoyable experience. I would definitely stay here again!",
      "Fantastic downtown location with easy access to everything. The unit was clean, well-stocked, and fully functional, except for the clothes dryer. Unfortunately, despite two repair attempts during my stay, it still didn\u2019t work properly. While the hosts were responsive when contacted, the issue remained unresolved. Overall, a decent stay with some room for improvement.",
      "Amazing place, great location, hosts were very good at communicating. Would definitely stay here again!",
      "Everything was excellent.. My only comment is that you only have two beds and the third bed is a sofa.. Sometimes we don't agree on who will sleep on the sofa",
      "Positives: Excellent location,  clean, convenient parking, communicative hosts<br/>Negatives: AC does not work well, polyester sheets feel quite cheap",
      "We enjoyed our stay at this apartment! The location is great, the unit is clean and comfortable, with a nice view!",
      "Really friendly and quick to respond, was In a great location for what we needed while at the stampede, would definitely go back !!!",
      "Thank you for a great stay! The location is unbeatable - close to all the best restaurants, shops and the stampede. The place was clean and modern. Thanks again!",
      "Beautiful, clean place and incredibly conveniently located. Great and communicative hosts. I would easily stay here again.",
      "We were here for four nights on our first trip to Calgary! The location couldn\u2019t be better, it\u2019s very clean and they have thought of everything. The coffee and creamers were especially appreciated! Would stay again and recommend this unit to anyone wanting to visit Calgary!"

So if you have a night flight, consider this, as check-in is not 100% self-service.",

Not too far and not too close from upper downtown where we spent most of our time.<br/>However, with the windows closed, it is really calm in the apartment.<br/>On the opposite side, the entrance door is not soundproof and if your neighbors do not respect the building rules in the middle of the night, you'll hear them!<br/>Everything was as described and even better than expected. But there is one thing that could be annoying for people sleeping on the convertible sofa or in the primary bedroom: there are filtering curtains in the bedroom and in the living room except on the balcony glass door. Since the primary bedroom sliding doors are made of frosted glass, it lets light through somehow.<br/>Overall, the stay was good.",

Regarding early-morning check-ins, we ask for a set check-in time because our cleaners need adequate time to thoroughly clean and prepare the unit after the previous guest.

We hope to have the opportunity to host you again under smoother circumstances."

There are also towels, spare linens and toiletries. Everything is lovingly arranged and decorated. <br/>The apartment is one street south of downtown and the train tracks, so all downtown attractions and public transport are within walking distance. <br/>The three of us lived in the apartment, the space was sufficient, but you had to juggle a bit and keep things in order so that you could move. Wardrobes are available, but only equipped with clothes rails, so you can't store wardrobe and other things well.<br/>Supermarkets are within walking distance and the view is great!"

Alles ist liebevoll arrangiert und dekoriert. <br/>Die Wohnung liegt eine Stra\u00dfe s\u00fcdlich der Downtown und der Bahnschienen, sodass alle Sehensw\u00fcrdigkeiten und \u00f6ffentliche Verkehrsmittel der Innenstadt einfach zu Fu\u00df zu erreichen sind. <br/>Wir haben zu dritt in der Wohnung gewohnt, der Platz war zwar ausreichend, aber man musste schon etwas jonglieren und Ordnung halten, damit man sich bewegen kann. Kleiderschr\u00e4nke sind zwar vorhanden, aber nur mit Kleiderstangen ausgestattet, sodass man Garderobe und anderes nicht gut verstauen kann.<br/>Superm\u00e4rkte sind in der N\u00e4he fussl\u00e4ufig erreichbar und die Aussicht super!",

      "Paul was a super responsive and friendly host. Very accommodating. <br/>The place itself was perfect for what we needed. Very much walkable into the city centre whilst being out of the way enough to be quiet through the night. <br/>Had all the amenities listed and everything was easy to use and worked as it should. <br/>Would totally recommend :) Thank you!",
      "We had a wonderful stay! The apartment was very clean, spacious, and comfortable. The location was perfect \u2014 there were plenty of great restaurants within walking distance, and every place we tried was delicious. We only wish we had more time to explore even more of the neighborhood. Overall, a fantastic place to stay, and we\u2019d definitely book again!",
      "This was a fantastic stay in a great unit. The location was central, with lots of nearby amenities, convenience, and ability to quickly make your way around Calgary.  The unit was as described, bright, airy and very well stocked for the whole length of our stay.",
      "Perfect place for our stay in Calgary. Very easy to walk to downtown but also to go for walks in the park and along the water. Accommodation was exactly as expected from photos and had everything we needed for our stay including a washer and dryer. <br/>Paul was always quick to respond to any questions we had ahead of our stay and was very accommodating in response to a few requests we had. Would definitely recommend!",
      "Paul\u2019s place was the perfect landing pad for a couple nights in Calgary! It\u2019s a quiet and peaceful building on a pretty chill residential street close to the river, yet so close to food, shopping, Sled Island venues, groceries, etc. Paul was a very friendly and responsive host, and the space had everything we needed for a comfortable stay. We would definitely recommend and would book again!",
      "Not exactly sound proof: walking noises from upstairs and traffic is a bit loud in the evening.<br/>Fan is making noises.<br/>It may be due to construction, the unit is a bit dusty.<br/>Not enough supplies such as detergent.<br/>Washing/drying machines need servicing. A lot of lint left on clothing after washing/drying.",

      "We have stayed in Airbnbs all over the world and this was one of our all-time favourites. A few things stood out: 1. You can\u2019t beat the location. Mission is very close to downtown Calgary and walkable to the river, a fantastic fitness facility and many excellent restaurants and cafes. 2. The apartment itself is very clean, quiet, and well-appointed. It\u2019s such a treat to arrive and discover a place has everything you need for a comfortable stay - coffee, shampoo, laundry detergent etc.. 3. A comfy bed and a great shower! 4. Responsive hosts. They literally reply to questions in minutes. <br/>We have family in Calgary so will definitely stay again. Hopefully longer next time!",

      "This was a very lovely condo and was extremely clean and tidy.  There was lots of extra bedding for the pullout couch and we even discovered that there were 3 different types of pillows depending on your preference.  It is in a very walkable neighbourhood with lots of shops and restaurants nearby.  We will definitely stay here again!",

It comfortably accommodates  two guests but we can host up to three guests thanks to a pull-out couch. It boasts a prime location just off the vibrant 17th avenue, steps away from shopping, entertainment, nightlife, parks, transit, sports venues, and urgent care. **NOTE: The condo has recently had a fresh coat of paint and the art\u2019s come down, but it still wraps you up in cozy vibes like a favorite sweater <3The spaceWhile small, the suite has a dedicated bedroom with a queen bed, and a pullout  couch in the living room. The entire unit would be yours for your stay, you do not share with other guests.Guest accessKeys and Access fob will be given upon check-inOther things to notePlenty of free street parking nearby. The Sheldon Chumir Urgent Care Centre is just a 5-minute walk away, as is Safeway for your grocery needs. You\u2019ll also find a pharmacy and liquor store right across the street, along with a great selection of cafes and restaurants just around the corner. Overall, it\u2019s a fantastic location for an inner city Calgary experience. If you\u2019re visiting during Stampede, you can\u2019t beat the location; walking distance to the grounds!Registration DetailsBL260632",

      "Great location, great space. the furniture could use some updating but minor in the grand scheme of things. everything is very walkable, parking isn't too difficult to manage. I would absolutely stay here again. All the best!",
      "Overall great experience! The condo was clean and homey. Very convenient location with lots of restaurants and bars around. A grocery store being walkable distance is also a huge plus. Had to park my car on the street but finding a spot wasn't too bad.",
      "Torie and Tyler were super flexible with our plans. They responded quite quickly to any questions we had. Their place is walkable to a lot of amenities and funky restaurants. Street was quiet. Would definitely stay here again!",
      "We had a great stay! The place was clean, comfortable, and exactly as described. The host was responsive, which made everything smooth. Perfect for a short trip. Would definitely book again!",
      "Great place \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffe Torie and Tyler  communicated well. Despite not being able to enjoy the area its in an excellent area for dining, walking and enjoying the 17 Ave vibe! Thank you \ud83d\ude0a",
      "Super convenient location and the condo was the perfect meet between everything you could have needed and the perfect amount of space!! Torie and Tyler were ever so accommodating. I really enjoyed my stay, thank you",
      "Tone of voice host used was not professional. Location is good. Parking is fine but has handicap sign. Wasn\u2019t sure if it was correct to park there. Nails popping out on table. No A/C.",
      "Great location and perfect size. I\u2019ll be staying there again whenever I\u2019m back in the area. Very happy with everything.",
      "Great place! Very clean, close to a lot of activities and restaurants but still in a quiet street.",
      "Extremely clean and great view from the balcony! <br/>I\u2019ll definitely book again the location was amazing and the apartment has everything I\u2019ll ever need",
      "Great price for location. Check-in time of 5pm was a little abnormal but we made it work. Clean space and great balcony view.",
      "easy check in instructions and very responsive! the apartment has a great view! plus the parking lot makes everything easier!<br/>totally recommend!",
      "Okay location- somewhat convenient. Apartment walls and doors were dirty, sofa bed was broken and uncomfortable. Parking was a nightmare, check-in and out was complicated. Host had their notifications silenced so we had to wait a bit for getting checked in, and they weren\u2019t great with their response times. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d stay here again.",
      "Great Apt close to 17th Ave and very walkable. Bed was comfortable and the place was spotless clean",
      "Beautiful place, lovely interior. Torie and Tyler were amazing hosts and so responsive and flexible! recommend this place to everyone!",
      "In the heart of the city.<br/>Highly recommended!!<br/>Comfortable and very clean place.<br/>Beautiful views from the balcony.<br/>Very nice location.",
      "A wonderful spot to stay if you want to feel connected to the big Calgary city life. Comfy bed, warm shower and amazing restaurants nearby.",
      "Tori and Tyler\u2019s place was an absolute gem of a place. It was very clean and was just as pictured. They were super reliable and responsive and I would love to stay here again!",
      "Our stay at Torie and Tyler\u2019s place was fantastic! The space was clean, cozy, and exactly as described. The hosts were super responsive, went out of their way to accommodate our schedule, and made check-in a breeze. The location was perfect for exploring Calgary. I\u2019d definitely book again!",
      "Clean, affordable, and very easy check in, not to mention it being smack dab in a beautiful location. Absolutely loved the cute cozy interior even though i wasnt there for very long, the place had everything youd need and it comes with a great view. Holing to visit again if im in calgary.",
      "Beautiful high-end kitchen with all the amenities. Super clean. Stayed here one night with my son, and the neighborhood was filled with great restaurants and walkable. The hosts were really helpful with recommendations and considerations, and very friendly and responsive. <br/>Only thing I would say is that I would recommend leaving any large suitcases in the car as there is not much space to move around inside the unit with all the decorations. not much space to move around in the kitchen once the chairs are placed around the table. No noise at all and a phenomenal view.",
      "Great place, excellent location. Only stayed 1 night but came away very relaxed. Had a nice bath in their soaker tub, and enjoyed the beautiful view of the city lights. Thanks again!",
      "Nice place, fantastic location with lots of nice bars and cafes nearby. Only thing was there are no blinds over the balcony door, so you will get a ton of sunshine in the morning, which could be an issue if you're a light sleeper.",
      "We had such a wonderful time at your Airbnb! It was cute, comfortable, had everything we needed, and was in a great location.  Thank you SO much!<br/>The reviews about the place being small are a bit overblown. It\u2019s a studio apartment and has everything you\u2019d need. It\u2019s far better than a hotel.<br/>The other reviews about the check-in time seem strange. We found the host accommodating and friendly. They were clear about their check-in and check-out times. As a night owl it was perfect to have such a late check-out time."

The C-train, Stampede grounds and MNP Sports Centre are also a 10-15 minute walk.  Additionally, there are a variety of parks and river pathways in the area. Eau Claire Market and Prince's Island Park are about a 35 minute walk north, which is a gorgeous area to wander around in the summer - with shops, dining and a splash park for children to enjoy. The Elbow river is around a 15 minute walk south and is great for its running pathways, parks, outdoor pool, BBQ pits and rafting during summer months."

No noise at all and a phenomenal view.",

Thank you SO much!<br/>The reviews about the place being small are a bit overblown. It\u2019s a studio apartment and has everything you\u2019d need. It\u2019s far better than a hotel.<br/>The other reviews about the check-in time seem strange. We found the host accommodating and friendly. They were clear about their check-in and check-out times. As a night owl it was perfect to have such a late check-out time.",

The home is incredibly spacious, with modern furniture and a well-kept interior that made us feel right at home. Lisbeth was an outstanding host attentive, kind, and made sure we had everything we needed throughout our stay. The location couldn\u2019t be better: just a short 10-minute walk to Stephen Avenue and downtown, with food and shopping amenities close by. Highly recommended!",

      "Great location, super neat and tidy condo. Lisbeth was an excellent host. Super easy to communicate with. Only thing was the AC wasn\u2019t as cold as it should\u2019ve been but then again, we ran into another couple and they mentioned how their AC wasn\u2019t working as well so I think it\u2019s just a building issue that was fully out of her control. Besides that, we had an amazing stay. Would totally come again in the future",
      "Great location, in the heart of Calgary downtown, walkable distance to great restaurants. On top of everything , it has the most amazing views of all airbnb we visited. Lisbeth is amazing and respond pretty much immediately to all of our questions. Highly recommend and will definitely be back next time we visit Calgary. Thanks Lisbeth again!",

I wish i was staying for a longer period of time as this place was perfect for many reasons.",
      "Out of all the air b&b I\u2019ve stayed at this was top #1. She was so helpful in every way possible. Any obstacles I had she helped me around them. My plans changed last minute and she was there to help me. Everything was great, her place was beautiful and made me feel as if it was my own. 10/10 will stay or recommend to stay at her place. 5 stars really isn\u2019t enough for what she did for me.",
      "My second time staying here and like the first time it was absolutely wonderful!! Lisbeth is an amazing host. Always responsive and helpful. <br/>The view of this airbnb is beautiful morning or night. The place is cozy, and fully equipped with everything I needed. <br/>Walking distance from a couple restaurants, market, and subway and pizza place is just outside the building. Great location.<br/>Will definitely visit again!",

      "Great location, clean and well stocked apartment. Literally the only negative was a broken soap dispenser and the pullout bed is uncomfortable, but overall a great place to stay.",
      "As far as Airbnb hosts go, Samantha and zahid were phenomenal and exceeded expectations. They were incredibly quick to respond, helpful, and very pleasant to interact with. The place was exactly as described and was easy to find. There were instructions for everything we needed during our stay. Would highly recommend staying at their Airbnb!",
      "Samantha and Zahid\u2019s place was nice and clean. It was very close to lots of places to eat. I love how responsive there were and they provided clear instructions from check-in to checking out. The view was a great bonus, and they always let me know of any information pertaining to the building in a timely manner. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone visiting Calgary.",

      "Amazing accommodation, felt right at home and very central. Easy to find and great amenities!",
      "It was good wish faced the city but I forgot to ask dish washer smell gross could use a better cleaning in bedroom bathroom walls the outside of fridge and stove could have been cleaner and wasn't the best sleep as someone pulled a fire alarm but it was a very nice place felt at home and great hosts also daughter named the plant in the bedroom its name Thelma",
      "Had a great time, nothing negative to say as I enjoyed the room, had a good view of the city, the room was clean, and the hosts were kind.",
      "Perfect place to stay for a couples of nights. Excellent location, clean and comfy apt.",
      "A good location in Calgary for a reasonable price.",
      "Very conveniently located and clean space! A couple things were left to be desired (one single trash can, broken soap dispenser, surprise that second room had sliding not standard door), but these are small and not at all a big deal. The off-Airbnb extra app for check in instructions, including a surprise need to detour to pick up the keys from a corner mart 10 minutes away, was clunky and kind of annoying but ultimately easy enough to navigate (only accessible within a short window pre-check in, which made it difficult to plan ahead for this). Check out fortunately <br/>was easy! This apartment did just the job for a one night pre-airport stay with my boyfriend and mom, but I may not have chosen to stay longer. This would be a great place for a small bachelor(ette) trip or the like!",
      "liked everything about the apartment.",
      "Overall good stay, bedsheets and towels were not clean",
      "Good spot and good place to stay",
      "The dish washer was broken, and a limited supply of dish soap. You have to be careful if you parking in this building. Firstly, the parking instructions were not clear. You get into the parking area, and they will tell you the parking spot after you pay ($20/day). Better they charge along with booking. There was a limit supply of garbage bags. When I contacted the owners, they said there is no one available. The unit filled up with the cigarette smell the moment we turn off the AC.",
      "We had a great time, the place was amazing with a beautiful view. It\u2019s near everything you need from pubs to restaurants and even parks.. will definitely stay here again.",
      "This was a lovely place to come for a getaway. The apartment was beautiful, clean, very well thought out and well designed. A lot of time and effort has been put into it, which we appreciated. The hosts were very kind and excellent at communicating with us. The area was great to see, and to find places to eat. The only downside was that we had felt some standard kitchen items were missing - basic  condiments and cooking supplies, tea, scrubber for dishes, foil, plastic bags, and more basic baking pans. <br/>Overall a wonderful stay and would highly recommend.",

      "Pros:<br/>Perfection location, right in the middle of great food and bars.<br/>Clean, newer building. Excellent view.<br/>Parking stall was good, fit our SUV no problem. <br/>Cons:<br/>The property seems to be managed by a property manager without direct knowledge of the unit, which led to incorrect info. I had specifically asked whether the bedrooms had standard doors (for more privacy) instead of a sliding glass door, as the listing photos did not show doors but another listing in the same building had a glass sliding door. The property manager checked, then replied \"rest assured each room is equipped with standard doors\", so I booked this unit over the other listing despite this unit being more expensive and with worse check-in/out times. Unfortunately, once we stepped into the unit, we saw that it was indeed the sliding glass door. I informed the property manager about this and they did apologize and say they had mistaken it with another unit but nothing further was done.<br/>Overall still a good unit.",
      "The place is well organized and steps away from restaurants and shops. The location is great for a weekend away in Calgary!"

A couple things were left to be desired (one single trash can, broken soap dispenser, surprise that second room had sliding not standard door), but these are small and not at all a big deal. The off-Airbnb extra app for check in instructions, including a surprise need to detour to pick up the keys from a corner mart 10 minutes away, was clunky and kind of annoying but ultimately easy enough to navigate (only accessible within a short window pre-check in, which made it difficult to plan ahead for this). Check out fortunately <br/>was easy! This apartment did just the job for a one night pre-airport stay with my boyfriend and mom, but I may not have chosen to stay longer. This would be a great place for a small bachelor(ette) trip or the like!",

The only downside was that we had felt some standard kitchen items were missing - basic  condiments and cooking supplies, tea, scrubber for dishes, foil, plastic bags, and more basic baking pans. <br/>Overall a wonderful stay and would highly recommend.",

Excellent view.<br/>Parking stall was good, fit our SUV no problem. <br/>Cons:<br/>The property seems to be managed by a property manager without direct knowledge of the unit, which led to incorrect info. I had specifically asked whether the bedrooms had standard doors (for more privacy) instead of a sliding glass door, as the listing photos did not show doors but another listing in the same building had a glass sliding door. The property manager checked, then replied \"rest assured each room is equipped with standard doors\", so I booked this unit over the other listing despite this unit being more expensive and with worse check-in/out times. Unfortunately, once we stepped into the unit, we saw that it was indeed the sliding glass door. I informed the property manager about this and they did apologize and say they had mistaken it with another unit but nothing further was done.<br/>Overall still a good unit.",

      "Kelli and Jiad were incredibly accommodating, quick to respond and super friendly. Very easy to work with and the apartment was clean, convenient and exactly what I was looking for. An absolute pleasure to stay here and I\u2019ll definitely be back!",
      "The space is very clean, the building felt safe, and everything is as described. There were plenty of towels and even full ice cube trays in the fridge. Jiad is very responsive and accommodated an earlier check-out time for my early morning flight. I had a wonderful stay, would highly recommend.",
      "Jiad was a great host and very quick to respond. The neighbourhood felt safe and was a very short walk to the C Train as well as many shops and restaurants! I would definitely recommend his place and would stay here again in the future!",
      "We had an amazing stay at Jiad's place. Everything was smooth since the beginning, and he was very accomodating to our requests. He was very responsive to questions, and often checked up on us during the stay. The location was perfect, close to many restaurants, supermarkets and dowtown. It was really easy to go anywhere because it was really close to the train station as well. All in all we have an amazing stay!",
      "Thank you Jiad for the great stay! We appreciated how responsive you were and how you were happy to help resolve any issues we encountered. See you next time!",
      "Location great <br/>Nearby metro, just behind the building<br/>Nearby everything: banks, government offices & very nice park. <br/>Quite area and clean building",
      "We had a great stay at Jiad\u2019s place! The apartment was clean, cozy, and just as described. Perfect location \u2014 close to downtown attractions, restaurants, and the C-Train. An underground parking spot is available in the building. It can get a bit noisy at night from the train and yard, so light sleepers take note. Overall, I would highly recommend this place and would stay again.",
      "We had a great stay, the bed was comfy and easy to walk around the area!",
      "This condo was right in the centre of Calgary so good for doing things in the city. A dedicated parking space was a bonus for a city centre location",
      "Jiad was an excellent host! Very helpful and prompt responses. The apartment was clean and welcoming. He was also flexible with our checkout process. Great value!",
      "perfect location. small place but has everything. dusty but with having the windows open because of the hot weather that's to be expected. would definitely go back",
      "We stayed at Jiad's place because we needed a location close to Dickens - this was perfect, a 5-minute walk. The check-in was very easy with the liquor store holding the keys. If you need to leave before 9am on check out, this place might be an issue - you have to drop the keys off at the liquor store when it opens. For us, it was not a problem. The unit had everything we needed and looked like the photos. The bed was comfy. There is an issue with the pull-out sofa at the moment but we did mention to the host, as we had a 3rd person in the apartment with us. The host was very responsive and helpful. We had a couple questions regarding the check-in but he responded right away and got in the unit quickly. Overall, I would stay here again! Thanks, Jiad for having us.",
      "Jiad\u2019s place is comfortable and well-equipped. It\u2019s conveniently close to the station, making travel easy, and it offered everything we needed for daily life. We had a great time staying here and would definitely recommend it to others!",
      "Jiad\u2019s place is well located and clean. I stayed for a month and I had a great stay. There\u2019s everything you need and the host is super easy to communicate with. The check in was smooth and easy to do. Recommend staying at Jiad\u2019s place",

If you need to leave before 9am on check out, this place might be an issue - you have to drop the keys off at the liquor store when it opens. For us, it was not a problem. The unit had everything we needed and looked like the photos. The bed was comfy. There is an issue with the pull-out sofa at the moment but we did mention to the host, as we had a 3rd person in the apartment with us. The host was very responsive and helpful. We had a couple questions regarding the check-in but he responded right away and got in the unit quickly. Overall, I would stay here again! Thanks, Jiad for having us.",

      "Great place with a decent location, hard to find parking and the train right beside you is an inconvenience when it goes through the city 4 times a night. However minus this our stay was great and the hosts were very friendly and responsive, left very clear details on how to check in and all about the unit! Would stay again however I would bring earplugs this time!",
      "Clean and nice. Walkable to downtown.<br/>Communication could have been better and more prompt with regard to some things brought up with a broken piece of furniture. <br/>Other than that, we would stay again and recommend the flat.",
      "Nice place; however, received a request a week and a half later for $1000 regarding a missing key fob even though we left the fob where we found it. Hosts did not contact us with questions as to where we put it just left it to their management company to send us an accusatory message with the money request. I have since found similar reviews on their other properties. Not good practice and Airbnb should look into this!",
      "Ben and Lily's place is perfectly situated right in the heart of downtown. It is modern and welcoming and very well kept. Ben and Lily were always available and easy to communicate with. I stay here for a little over 2 weeks and have nothing negative I could say about the place. Highly recommend.",
      "Very clean and modern apartment in a fabulous location. Near everything you need. Host was very helpful and responsive when i needed help. Great place. Would stay again.",
      "The place looked just like the photos. It was super clean, cozy, and had such a nice view!",
      "I have stayed at this Airbnb and other apartments in this building several times. This is my favorite Airbnb. Yes, per the other reviews, there is a noisy train at night that runs several times, but it\u2019s not that bad. My advice would be to bring earplugs or a loud fan if loud sound bothers you at night. PLEASE DO NOT let the train keep you from staying at this place, because it\u2019s an amazing Airbnb. It\u2019s perfect with a washer and dryer, nice deep bathtub and powerful shower, kitchen with everything you need, dining and living area, VERY comfortable bed and pillows, and a balcony that shows a beautiful view of Downtown Calgary. It\u2019s only a 5 to 10 minute walk to the train. There are also many restaurants and pubs nearby, including a four story mall that\u2019s in downtown. Thank you for another pleasant experience!",
      "Lovely place, we really enjoyed our stay. Great and fast communicators, really appreciated that from Ben and Lilly! Great service. Really happy",
      "It was a very good location, barely had to drive anywhere. As a student it was nice to be in the same city but feel like you weren\u2019t in the campus atmosphere. It was very tidy and clean, they had very good communication and were easy to reach with any questions. They made it so easy to check in and out without any hassle. Definitely recommend if you want to have an effortless experience.",
      "Great place. It was very clean and covered home necessities. Walking around the area at night was okay, but not the best. Overall I would definitely recommend it.",
      "Very clean and easy to access. Beautiful view of downtown! Would definitely go back.",
      "Listed on booking free parking however it was not. And place is smaller than I expected. Not worth the money I paid for in my opinion. <br/>Nice location and clean.",
      "Great hosts, accurate description and very responsive to questions.  The condo is exactly as described.",
      "Stayed for birthday weekend. Did not disappoint! Heaps of bars and restaurants close by walkable distance to everything!! Would 100% stay again!",
      "It was a very clean place with beautiful cityscapes. One problem we encountered was with entering the building and response/troubleshooting that could have been delivered in a more timely manner. The buzzly app that they use was not optimal for entering the airbnb and hosts had to resend the link. Not ideal. Otherwise the hosts were good at answering our questions prior to check in and the place was true to photos for the most part. Couch did have a huge tear unfortunately.",
      "A beautiful place to stay! The view is amazing, and almost everything you could need is in walking distance! Ben and Lily were very well at communicating and making sure we were more then happy with our stay!",
      "The view was beautiful, and the location was fantastic. Unfortunately, we encountered some issues during our stay. The bathroom was not clean, with hair on the bath, and the bed was extremely uncomfortable, preventing us from getting a good night's sleep. As a result, we felt sore for the next few days. Ultimately, we decided to cancel our reservation. The management was understanding and refunded the remaining nights while still charging us for the first night.",
      "Fantastic Stay in Downtown Calgary!<br/>I had an amazing stay at Ben and Lily\u2019s apartment in downtown Calgary. The space was spotless, beautifully furnished, and had all the amenities needed for a comfortable stay. The location is perfect\u2014within walking distance of great restaurants, shops, and public transportation. The check-in process was seamless, and Ben and Lily were incredibly responsive and accommodating. I highly recommend this place to anyone visiting Calgary and would definitely stay here again!",

      "The apartment was decorated so beautifully and had the prettiest view of downtown Calgary. It was also very clean when we first entered. We had a wonderful time and for our next visit of city we definitely will be choosing to stay there again!",

        "review": "I have stayed at this Airbnb and other apartments in this building several times. This is my favorite Airbnb. Yes, per the other reviews, there is a noisy train at night that runs several times, but it\u2019s not that bad. My advice would be to bring earplugs or a loud fan if loud sound bothers you at night. PLEASE DO NOT let the train keep you from staying at this place, because it\u2019s an amazing Airbnb. It\u2019s perfect with a washer and dryer, nice deep bathtub and powerful shower, kitchen with everything you need, dining and living area, VERY comfortable bed and pillows, and a balcony that shows a beautiful view of Downtown Calgary. It\u2019s only a 5 to 10 minute walk to the train. There are also many restaurants and pubs nearby, including a four story mall that\u2019s in downtown. Thank you for another pleasant experience!",

      "Awesome stay, location is truly perfect, and this unit is very well equipped! My only complaint would be the lighting in the main bedroom and both bathrooms is very dim, which made doing my makeup a little challenging! Otherwise, amazing and we would definitely book again!",
      "place in down town alot of restaurants  and actives to do. great spot \ud83d\udc4c",
      "Mitchell is a great host, the check in and out instructions were clear and easy and the place was clean. We enjoyed our stay at his listing!",
      "Stayed at Mitchell's place for a girls night and the views were incredible!!! it was super cool to see the calgary tower from the windows. Very clean, had one parking spot. What could be improved for the future is more detailed instructions. For example, we didn't know where exactly to put the garbage before checking out because the location was unlisted. Overall, very satisfied with our stay \ud83d\ude03.",
      "We had a fantastic 3-night stay here! The place is beautiful, cozy, and well-equipped with everything you need, from toiletries to a fully stocked kitchen. Mitchell, the host, was amazing\u2014friendly, helpful, and very responsive. Plus, the recommendations for nearby activities and restaurants were spot on. Highly recommend!",
      "Couldn't ask for a better location. The condo was so beautiful at night too, with the city lights. Can't beat this place especially with the parking spot. Loved the ice machine and the the filtered water tap! Speaker was easy to hook up tpo, and the welcome booklet was online and easy to navigate. Thanks!",
      "The location is great. The place itself was also nice. The only issue is how to get inside the place. I had to ask a resident to get me through the garage and when i left the place on my last day I had to ask another resident to let me out haha.",
      "Very cool place! Awesome views and walkable to many nearby restaurants and bars. Mitchell was a very responsive host who went the extra mile making sure we checked in successfully after we arrived later than expected. Would stay here again.",
      "This was a very nice apartment style setting, with a great view of the city. Everything was clean, organized and aesthetically pleasing. Bed and couch were very comfortable.",
      "Our visit when off without a hitch. Mitchell was responsive and very accommodating. The apartment was beautiful and very well located close to the Calgary stampede. <br/>10/10 would recommend",
      "I had a fantastic stay at this Airbnb in Calgary! The location is absolutely perfect, being within walking distance to the Stampede grounds and directly across from several great restaurants. The convenience of having such amazing dining options and entertainment nearby made my trip incredibly enjoyable. The host was very accommodating and provided everything I needed for a comfortable stay. I highly recommend this place to anyone visiting Calgary, especially if you want to be close to the action and enjoy the local scene. The airbnb was extremely clean which made a very comfortable stay.",
      "Mitchell was an amazing host. Super responsive! The place was beautiful. It\u2019s right in the center of Calgary and the place has pretty much everything you need! Amazing gorgeous place! Wish we could spend more time in this apartment. Highly recommend.",
      "Very nice condo with easy access to many restaurants and the city.  We walked all over the city!  The condo was very clean.  Somehow we missed the door code in the instructions so it was a little difficult getting in but Mitchell was very responsive and got back to us quickly and we were in!  The second bedroom could use some better shades to darken it completely other wise the accommodations were excellent!  The other issue we had was leaving.  You need the key fob to get to the car park and to get out of the garage.  So you need to get the car out then bring all the keys back up and drop them off in the condo. We probably didn't read the instructions properly  :)    Don't forget that!!",
      "The access instructions were clear but a bit complicated. Exiting from the unit to the car park was tricky, as you needed a fob that was inside the unit, which made leaving more difficult. <br/>The unit matched the description, and the city lights and view were beautiful. The location is great, with a short walk to Calgary Tower and the nearby shopping mall.<br/>However, there were a few issues during our stay:<br/>- The main room bedding, particularly the \u2018black sheets\u2019 and bedding were dusty.<br/>- The coffee machine had dirty pods left inside and wasn\u2019t clean.<br/>- The ice maker had stale water with an unpleasant smell.<br/>- We found clothing from previous guests in the unit.<br/>- There were old, used sheets at the bottom of the wardrobe.<br/>Overall, it didn\u2019t feel like the unit was fully prepared for our visit.",
      "Nice and clean! Was very helpful and quick to respond when an issue arouse. Only there one night but was worth it! Beautiful view",
      "Great place to stay very clean and the host was very responsive and helpful 10/10 would recommend staying here.",
      "Place was left a mess and was not cleaned before we got there. Toilet was dirty and had poop stains, sheets had stains and another were wet. The beds were not made and since we were staying only one night was an inconvenience to have to wash ourselves. We ended up not staying there it was just too much. How we the host made it write and was apologetic and immediately offered to make accommodations and offered and immediate refund and then offered extra for our hassle. I don\u2019t fault him at all, the place looked beautiful but given our short stay and the place not being up to anyone\u2019s standards we chose another location. I would only ask the host be more thorough in checking on the services he uses to clean. Other than that the location and apt would have been great to experience.",

Somehow we missed the door code in the instructions so it was a little difficult getting in but Mitchell was very responsive and got back to us quickly and we were in!  The second bedroom could use some better shades to darken it completely other wise the accommodations were excellent!  The other issue we had was leaving.  You need the key fob to get to the car park and to get out of the garage.  So you need to get the car out then bring all the keys back up and drop them off in the condo. We probably didn't read the instructions properly  :)    Don't forget that!!",

        "review": "The access instructions were clear but a bit complicated. Exiting from the unit to the car park was tricky, as you needed a fob that was inside the unit, which made leaving more difficult. <br/>The unit matched the description, and the city lights and view were beautiful. The location is great, with a short walk to Calgary Tower and the nearby shopping mall.<br/>However, there were a few issues during our stay:<br/>- The main room bedding, particularly the \u2018black sheets\u2019 and bedding were dusty.<br/>- The coffee machine had dirty pods left inside and wasn\u2019t clean.<br/>- The ice maker had stale water with an unpleasant smell.<br/>- We found clothing from previous guests in the unit.<br/>- There were old, used sheets at the bottom of the wardrobe.<br/>Overall, it didn\u2019t feel like the unit was fully prepared for our visit.",
        "host_response": "Thank you for your thoughtful feedback, Natalie. We\u2019re happy to hear that you enjoyed the location, views, and the condo overall. We sincerely apologize for the issues you encountered during your stay. Maintaining high standards of cleanliness is crucial for us, and we\u2019re sorry that we didn\u2019t meet those standards during your visit. We\u2019ve discussed your feedback with our cleaning team to make sure these issues are addressed and resolved for future guests.<br/>We also understand that the fob process for the garage can be inconvenient. We\u2019ve updated our instructions and check-out process to make it more straightforward for future guests. Your feedback is incredibly valuable to us, and we appreciate you bringing these matters to our attention. We hope you\u2019ll consider staying with us again, so we can provide you with a much-improved experience."

        "review": "Place was left a mess and was not cleaned before we got there. Toilet was dirty and had poop stains, sheets had stains and another were wet. The beds were not made and since we were staying only one night was an inconvenience to have to wash ourselves. We ended up not staying there it was just too much. How we the host made it write and was apologetic and immediately offered to make accommodations and offered and immediate refund and then offered extra for our hassle. I don\u2019t fault him at all, the place looked beautiful but given our short stay and the place not being up to anyone\u2019s standards we chose another location. I would only ask the host be more thorough in checking on the services he uses to clean. Other than that the location and apt would have been great to experience.",
        "host_response": "Thank you for your feedback, Thomas. I'm very sorry for the inconvenience you experienced. Unfortunately, our cleaner claimed she completed the job, but clearly, she did not show up. We have since hired a new cleaner to ensure this doesn't happen again. I appreciate your understanding, and I'm glad we could resolve the issue promptly. I hope to have the opportunity to host you again under better circumstances."

      "My wife and I had the pleasure to see Calgary for the first time while visiting family who had recently moved there.<br/>Fairly new with Air BNB however, we are getting the hang of it. <br/>The condo unit was perfect, we felt right at home.<br/>Clean, quiet, secure, great views and fantastic location. <br/>Our host was quick to reply to any questions or concerns.<br/>As we plan on travelling to Calgary more often, this place will be our first choice if available.",

      "I loved this AirBnb accommodation. It is a gorgeous, light-filled space with beautiful furnishings and many thoughtful amenities like bottled water, chips, and a generous Starbucks gift card, and also body lotion and a blow dryer. The mattress in the main bedroom was super comfortable for me, as were the pillows (I tend to be very fussy). Honestly, I felt so comfortable and well, I didn't want to leave. As for the location, there's so much to get to within walking distance, including an excellent food court right across the street. Thank you so much. I felt like a queen.",

Otherwise, it was exactly as listed, EOS was fantastic with communication and gave very clear instructions.",

      "A beautiful appartment right in the heart of Calgary. A spacious, clean, comfortable appartment in a great location close to all the amenities of the city. We felt right at home straight away and had a great stay. Kyle and Andrew responded very quickly to any query we had. We would definitely stay here again when visiting Calgary.",
      "What a beautiful condo! It is right in the heart of Calgary and had all of the amenities and views. The parking and access was straight forward, and Kyle was a communicative host. Having an Italian restaurant downstairs was AWESOME. Highly recommend grabbing dinner there. Thank you for the recommendations and wonderful stay!",
      "We really enjoyed our stay and the apartment looked exactly like on the photos! The view was amazing and we loved watching the sunrise und sunset from the balcony. Location-wise it was right in the middle between the river and the shopping/bar district which was great for walking and exploring the city on foot. Thanks again for letting us stay at your beautiful place!",
      "This  booking was exactly what we needed, we came to Calgary to eventually go visit Banff but pricing out there is too much. Kyle\u2019s listing was so central that we were able to go around the city by foot and quickly drive down to Banff less than 2hrs usually. The parking included was worth it and I highly encourage to book this place. The view from the patio is a great as it is in the picture and there\u2019s a really good Italian spot around the corner. When we needed something (ie refill on laundry detergent) our host was so quick to provide. This was a great book and look forward to referring my friends here when they visit",
      "We had a great stay! The apartment was immaculate and just like the photos. Its location is very convenient, close to shops, restaurants, and public transportation. Kyle and Andrew were very responsive and helpful throughout our visit.",
      "I had an exceptional stay at this beautiful Airbnb in downtown Calgary. The apartment was spotless, well-organized, and thoughtfully set up for a comfortable experience. Waking up to the stunning view of the Calgary Tower each day was a real highlight. The location was perfect right in the heart of the city, with everything within walking distance. Communication with the host was smooth, and every detail was taken care of. Highly recommend this place to anyone visiting Calgary",
      "I loved, loved, loved my stay at Kyle & Andrew's beautiful condo.  It was so lovely, well decorated and comfortable.  It looks even more stunning than the online photos.  I highly recommend it.",
      "We found the beds to be really comfy and enjoyed the views from the apartment. Kyle's place is walking distance to great shops and restaurants.",
      "Kyle & Andrew are great hosts, would definitely recommend and book again! Beautiful space and views",
      "The suite is exactly as advertised with beautiful furniture and a great downtown view.  It was very tidy and well organized.  We stayed over a major cold snap so spent little time outdoors in the neighbourhood but I believe it is well located in the downtown area.  Safe and quiet. Hosts leave clear instructions and were kind enough to check in with us during our stay.",
      "Beautiful stay and great vibes here! The photos and descriptions exactly match up to this Airbnb. Everything was very clean and well-stocked with linens, towels, and cleaning supplies. I would definitely rebook to this exact location or their other locations. Hosts are very communicative and respond in a timely manner.",
      "We had such a great stay here! We loved it for our small family (two adults, one toddler.) It felt like just the right size and our little guy absolutely loved the incredible view and decor. We felt very spoiled staying here. Everything was so comfy and the included parking was extremely appreciated. Thank you for having us!!",
      "Nice and cosy place that matches the description and has a nice view. Well equipped and good location to explore Calgary. We were 3 and with 2 bedrooms this was excellent. Very communicative hosts.<br/>When air heating/cooling system is active,  one can hear it well. We switched it off to sleep. Street noise with windows open, as expected in large city. With windows closed, it is OK.<br/>Italiaan restaurant Scarpetta in the same building is very good. Also Thai Sa-On 2 blocks east is nice.",
      "Great unit and a great location. Easy walk to the train which can get you to the zoo and many other kid friendly activities. Great restaurants all around. Very prompt and helpful communication from the owners. Would stay again.",
      "Kyle and Andrew\u2019s place was amazing. The place was extremely clean and was as exactly described. They were great hosts and were easy to communicate with. I would definitely stay again!",
      "Thank you Kyle and Andrew for hosting my wife and I in your beautifully designed urban apartment. We enjoyed the immaculate facilities and homely decor. The views of downtown and outwards towards the Rocky Mountains were breathtaking.",
      "A wonderful apartment, with meticulous attention to detail and clear instructions. It was also very clean and matched the description and images. Overall, the hosts were responsive and helpful. Enjoyed my stay.",
      "Apartment looks exactly like photos although felt smaller than expected but still suited our needs. The view was amazing to wake up to every morning. Apartment was clean and had everything we needed. The kids loved the place!",
      "The condo was perfect for our needs and had everything we could have wanted. Lots of electrical outlets in convenient places to plug in our devices, an incredible view, comfortable furniture, great lighting (especially in the bathroom) and an appealing modern aesthetic. We could walk to wherever we needed to go. Underground parking was a bonus. Getting into the building without the fob was a bit tricky but the security personnel were very helpful. And when I left the fob INSIDE the condo, Kyle was very quick to respond and help us fix our mistake. I would definitely stay there again.",
      "Kyle\u2019s place was very nice! The communication was great and everything was a breeze. The space had everything we needed to cook, watch great movies, and relax. The pics don\u2019t do the place any justice. I\u2019d definitely reserve again.",
      "the apartment has a very good location if you want to do something in Calgary and want to look at the city. the apartment itself was very tastefully decorated with a personal style and modern, it was very clear and functional and yet also with a warm feel-good atmosphere",
      "Great stay for our weekend away!",
      "one of the cleanest places i\u2019ve ever stayed at!",
      "The view is amazing, clean comfortable place. The host was responsive and helpful will definitely book again."

Kyle\u2019s listing was so central that we were able to go around the city by foot and quickly drive down to Banff less than 2hrs usually. The parking included was worth it and I highly encourage to book this place. The view from the patio is a great as it is in the picture and there\u2019s a really good Italian spot around the corner. When we needed something (ie refill on laundry detergent) our host was so quick to provide. This was a great book and look forward to referring my friends here when they visit",

      "The apartment is in a great area, super close to some amazing restaurants. It\u2019s also only a short walk to the downtown shopping area and other attractions like the river walk. The apartment itself was clean and comfortable and watching the sun come up and the city lit up at night from the enormous windows was incredible.",
      "Honestly you can get more centrally located! In the Beltline area of Calgary there\u2019s no lack of restaurants and landmarks to get to from the condo. The building is secure and we always felt safe. The views from the condo are amazing. Daytime or nighttime skyline views. There\u2019s a bar called Proof right downstairs to grab a late night cocktail or a bite to eat too! It was a favorite. Drop off and pick up by Uber was easy to this location too!",
      "This location is amazing! Parking is easy, safe and underground. The king bed is comfortable. The blinds let alot of light in, beautiful, but bring an eye mask if you\u2019re sensitive to light for sleeping. Our host was very friendly and easy to communicate with. The apartment was quiet and felt very safe. Would definitely recommend.",
      "Great stay, and awesome view. For a large building, unit was quiet, especially with having little ones. View itself was worth it, as had a good full view of Calgary Tower. Place was clean and as advertised for a unit in the downtown area of beltline. Communication with hosts was fast and any concerns or questions were immediately addressed. Would book again for sure!",
      "All I can say is amazing, the bnb was beautiful and our trip to Calgary was so much fun. Perfect place to stay at and I definitely recommend staying with them!<br/>All together definitely will be rebooking:)",
      "The location is great, it has nice views, clean place, but it has a stale smell when you first walk in.  We had an issue with the bathroom door that wouldn't close all the way living an open gap, when I notified the owner she came to see the door and said go head and use it like that, but having  an open gap you have no privacy.  Also one of the couches was broken, they notified us that it was scheduled to be repaired. Hopefully the owner can repair this issues soon.",
      "Great price for a clean, centrally located Beltline apartment with parking and a panoramic view. <br/>Downsides: a broken, sagging couch; slow-draining tub; chipped paint, worn floors, and a torn balcony screen. <br/>Check-in and checkout were cumbersome (grab fob from the unit, go back to the car, etc.). The house rules document sent at check-in was much stricter and fine-heavy than what was on the listing. <br/>The host was pleasant and responsive but didn\u2019t fix anything during the stay. <br/>Overall: good value if you can live with the maintenance issues and the extra friction.",
      "I loved getting the opportunity to book with Selase and would definitely book with them again! The space was comfortable, great views and ideal location. Selase was very communicative and helpful.",

      "Great hosts, good views of the city, nice parking space that fits an SUV/truck. Overal place has some signs of wear & tear. Not quite the luxury condo as advertised. Price is imo a bit steap. But it is as downtown as it gets. Bed is quite comfy, though the place gets very light.",

      "We had a wonderful stay at this condo! Selase was a great host, the condo was in a prime location very walkable to bars and restaurants right in downtown. The place was cozy and check-in was very easy. A plus that it came with parking as well. The city views from the condo were beautiful but it was never too noisy. Selase was responsive and helpful. I highly recommend a stay here!",
      "We booked this last minute due to being unable to stay at a hotel we had previously booked, host was very responsive and we were able to book & check in very quick! Host was very responsive and checked in to ensure everything was going well in the unit! Super conveniently located with many places to eat and short distance to other amenities, would love to stay here again next time I visit Calgary",

We had an issue with the bathroom door that wouldn't close all the way living an open gap, when I notified the owner she came to see the door and said go head and use it like that, but having  an open gap you have no privacy.  Also one of the couches was broken, they notified us that it was scheduled to be repaired. Hopefully the owner can repair this issues soon.",
        "host_response": "Thank you for your feedback. The issue with the door was due to expansion, which caused it not to close properly. We\u2019ve since had someone come in to take care of it, and it\u2019s now been fixed. Additionally, the parts for the sectional have arrived and the repair has been completed as well. Thanks again!"

The house rules document sent at check-in was much stricter and fine-heavy than what was on the listing. <br/>The host was pleasant and responsive but didn\u2019t fix anything during the stay. <br/>Overall: good value if you can live with the maintenance issues and the extra friction.",

      "We had a wonderful stay! The space was clean, cute, and cozy - just like the photos showed.

We\u2019d definitely stay here again!",

      "Well located for those requiring a place to stay downtown with 2 x bedrooms & kitchen. Street can be a little noisy at night, but that is natural for a downtown apartment in a big city.",
      "The location of the unit was GREAT, we walked to several restaurants, parks, playgrounds, etc. <br/>The building and unit are dated, but seemed safe. <br/>Check in was a little difficult, but after that initial time entering, it was super easy and convenient. <br/>Same with the garage/parking situation, only tricky at first. <br/>The host was quick and clear when communicating. <br/>It was worth the cost.<br/>Overall, I would recommend and stay at the unit again primarily because of location.",

The location is great, easy access to everything in the city as well as getting to the C train for trips further out. The apartment was just what we needed for visiting relations, plenty of space for a family of 4. A great kitchen, spacious bedrooms and great views. Thanks Anna \ud83d\ude03",
      "Anna was an excellent host and her place was fantastic! Check in instructions were straightforward and easy to follow and her home felt very welcoming and clean. The beds were super cozy, especially when you\u2019ve been outside exploring Calgary and beyond all day and there\u2019s a lot of restaurants coffee shops bars and a nice little grocery store all within walking distance, definitely worth staying in her Airbnb, if you visit Calgary!",
      "A perfect home base, for my family of 4 (children ages 12 & 14), while in Calgary, for a baseball tournament. Comfortable and homey. Anna, was attentive and friendly. Would definitely stay here again!",
      "Fantastic stay during a challenging work trip. Perfect location with incredible food options within 1 block.  Restaurant market across the street has probably 15 delicious food options. Apartment was new, very clean and stocked with coffee, water, and snacks.  Beds were extremely comfortable. We had to extend 1 day due to work and Anna was extremely responsive.  Will try to stay with Anna in this neighborhood next time I'm in Calgary. Thanks Anna!!!",

I\u2019m definitely sharing this listing with other friends who will be travelling to Calgary.",
      "Wonderful location, especially for going to an event at the Saddledome-just a 15 minute walk, albeit extremely cold, but that\u2019s winter in Calgary! Good restaurant and grocery options nearby and the unit was great-so nicely set up. Anna was so helpful, especially in quickly resolving a TV issue when the prior visitor logged out of the unit\u2019s Roku account. Would love to stay here again!",

      "Anastasia\u2018s place was awesome and we loved it! Great location, clean, private and quiet. We never heard any neighbors so the walls are well insulated in the condo. I would definitely stay here again. Anastasia was also great at responding when I did have questions about check-in.  The assigned parking under ground was also great and very conveniently located right by the door and . Finally, she was awesome and allowed my three Pomeranian dogs.",
      "Beautiful apartment in a great Location right near 17th ave (which has some of my favourite restaurants in the city). Also a very short Uber to the stampede grounds. The place was extremely clean and stocked with everything we needed. Anastasia was helpful and responsive to any questions we had. Thanks for hosting us. :)",
      "Listing was exactly as posted! Anastasiya herself is extremely responsive, literally within minutes. I had some difficulty getting into the listing itself and she walked me through it and then even offered to send someone to the listing ASAP to help me get in (I did figure it out). Location is within walking distance of downtown and we felt safe doing so. Couldn\u2019t hear any neighbors.",
      "Perfect place for my visit. Plenty of restaurants and shops very close, and BMO Centre and Saddledome walkable. Anastasiya was helpful, kind, and accommodating. I would definitely stay here again.",
      "Great condo for a quick stay. We loved the restaurants close by and very quick walk to our downtown location.",
      "Was a great stay. I would have loved to stay at little longer.<br/>Everything was clean and well organized.",
      "Anastasiya\u2019s place was perfect!! Great location, well-appointed, and spotless. I would definitely recommend it!",
      "Everything was perfect- super clean, spare towels, easy to get in, great location.",
      "Great location! We had 0 issues. Definitely recommend. Anastasiya was extremely helpful",
      "Great location,  walkable to transit station, exactly as described.",
      "Anastasiya\u2019s spot was perfect for what we needed. It was clean, spacious and within walking distance to a lively downtown area with tons of good restaurants.",
      "A truly lovely stay! The only thing I would\u2019ve changed is my flight so that I could stay longer. Everything we wanted and more. Thank you for the hospitality!",
      "Amazing host, very chill and friendly. Communication was excellent and she always helped work around my schedule!",
      "Excellent stay, good area, and good details on how to get into the place",
      "Very nice location that was very well-maintained",
      "We stayed here for 2 nights.We highly recommend this cottage.It feels like home as soon as you enter the door, it is very clean and tidy, and the host also made furniture adjustments according to our needs.The Host also helped us quickly resolve minor issues and gave us a lot of local guidance and recommendations.Really great Host and accommodation, thank you for hosting us.",
      "Everything in general was fine, there was only an uncomfortable smell in some rooms, I don't know if it was because of the rain or the ventilation of the building, or the apartment.",
      "Only stayed one night but it was perfect. Easy to find, includes underground parking (for a small vehicle), close to everything we came for and it was just like the pictures. We were able to walk to the Saddledome for a concert and it\u2019s only 2 blocks from 17th Ave. I would definitely stay here again.",
      "Would recommend this place. Overall very good stay and value. Great and easy checkin. Two sets of keys with fobs - great. Clean place. Great kitchen. Comfy bed. Nice patio. Lots of places for food and drinks nearby. Furnishings are a bit dated and dimmer lights on kitchen counter wouldn\u2019t stop flickering - minor things. Should be noted that 4th st where bedrooms face is quite noisy - bring earplugs if a light sleeper.",
      "We had a great stay at Anastasiya\u2019s place. We were there during the Calgary Stampede and it was in a fantastic location. It is close to bus stops to get to the stampede and to the downtown area. The place is also close to lots of great restaurants and there is a convenience store only a block away. We had a great time!",
      "it's a nice place in the trendy Mission district of downtown Calgary. location is really good, near everything. Place was nice, clean. refrigerator was a bit loud, but it appears as pretty new, works fine. Has protected underground parking in an easy to navigate parkade. Would highly recommend to anyone.",
      "My friend and I had a great stay at Anastasiya's place while visiting Calgary!  Everything was clean and comfortable and exactly as described. It was also in an excellent location - lots of great restaurants and trails within walking distance. I would recommend her place to anyone visiting the area."

      "We were very comfortable at Rui's place, staying a couple of nights. The place is set up well for 2 couples. The place is spotlessly clean, good location with easy access, and private. The beds are very comfortable. We liked the labels on the cupboards, easy to find everything! Rui is very responsive and easy to communicate with. I highly recommend Rui's apartment!",
      "Everything was as pictured. Great amount of space for two women going to a friends wedding- seperate bathrooms to get ready was a bonus. Very detailed house manual and the kitchen has everything you need.<br/>The place was spotless when we arrived. The area is very convenient for driving around Calgary and getting to the airport and Banff. Thankful for the parking spot for our rental car. Lots of grocery stores nearby. <br/>Would stay again!",
      "Rae's place is simply amazing, in a nice area and the communication was great, we could leave our suitcases way before the check-in because of some flight cancellation issues and that was a life changer for us travelling with a child. the apartment is beautifully decorated and is ultra clean, wow. We loved it thank you again for an incredible stay.",
      "Very clean and quiet 2 bed 2 bath condo that was perfect for our holiday. Very nice layout and the place was spotless when we arrived. Could not have asked for a better experience.",
      "Felt right at home.  It's the little extras that made the difference - well-stocked kitchen, complimentary snacks, well-stocked toiletries, laundry, and cleaning supplies, back-up AC.",
      "We loved our stay! Rae gave clear instructions (with pictures!) that made it easy to locate and get inside. Cupboards were clearly labeled so using the kitchen was a breeze - no checking all the drawers just to find a spoon. It was also well stocked.<br/>We appreciated how clean Rae's apartment was! Spotless and comfortable, we enjoyed our stay and would stay again.<br/>Rae was easy to communicate with and responded quickly. Thank you for a great experience, Rae!",
      "Overall I think Rui\u2019s place was the best place among all the four different Airbnb places that we stayed in Calgary. It\u2019s easy to check in and also spaces are clean. Location is convenient",
      "Rui's apartment was great! It was very complete with complimentary coffee and other goodies. We would have loved to stay longer but only had one night. The kitchen was well equipped and had a vast collection of herbs and spices. Bathrooms were also great, complimentary shampoos and soaps. One of the best Airbnb's I have stayed at.",
      "Our family had an amazing stay  at Rae's place. Everything went well, the appartement  was clean, very well furnished and great view. Located in downtown west close to everything, very walkable and easy access to highways. Having access to the CTrain right downstairs was very convenient too.<br/>Rae was always very responsive.<br/>It was a very positive experience.",
      "It was pouring rain when we arrived, in a city and tricky to drive. We couldn\u2019t find the building right away, but once we did, instructions were easy to follow, lots of pictures and host was very responsive to helping us! Space was just as pictured. Great views of the city, easy to park, drive wherever needed. Beds were comfortable and bathrooms were clean. 5 stars.",
      "We stayed at Rui appartment for a few weeks and really enjoyed our time here. The apartment was very clean, comfortable, and had beautiful views. We truly felt at home during our stay. The host was very kind and gave us clear and helpful instructions, which made everything easy. Highly recommended!",
      "Terrific place, very clean and beautifully decorated.  Loved all the decor - someone has good taste. Appreciated the snacks, comfortable beds, great view, location, great fully equipped kitchen.  Plenty of space, spotless. Very nice building.  You won't regret the stay.",
      "Rui is an excellent host. I liked the details Rui provided to access the property. They were very comprehensive. The house was good, spacious and well maintained. The location is perfect too, with two amazing Korean restaurants just outside the building. You can\u2019t enter the property after 9 without a fob which I think is a great step to ensure  safety. Rui provided lot of amenities especially in the Kitchen which was great. You may not see the mountains well so just don\u2019t choose if you plan to spend the evening looking at the mountains. Overall, it was a good stay.",
      "This place was great! Close to what we needed, easy to access restaurants and grocery store. Pictures to locate and explain entry were phenomenal and much appreciated. Condo was beautiful and clean and had everything we needed for a couple of days.",

The location is perfect too, with two amazing Korean restaurants just outside the building. You can\u2019t enter the property after 9 without a fob which I think is a great step to ensure  safety. Rui provided lot of amenities especially in the Kitchen which was great. You may not see the mountains well so just don\u2019t choose if you plan to spend the evening looking at the mountains. Overall, it was a good stay.",

      "I had a fantastic stay! Rihanna was an outstanding host, speedy to respond to any questions I had. The apartment was five-star quality and in a great location. I\u2019ll definitely book her place again the next time I\u2019m in town!",
      "Unfortunately we had issues with the HVAC and despite it being cool in Calgary (1 degree at night) we couldn\u2019t get the condo to cool down. Host did communicate with us throughout but she couldn\u2019t get anyone to fix the issues over the 3 days we were there. So we weren\u2019t comfortable the whole time.<br/>Otherwise if the heating issue gets fixed it\u2019s a great location, we have stayed in the same building before and it is our preferred location in the City. Unit is otherwise comfortable, clean and has everything you need for a short term stay.",
      "We really enjoyed our stay at Heart of Victoria Park. It was very clean and comfortable and within walking distance to some outstanding restaurants . Rhiannon was an excellent host who provided clear instructions and gave us great restaurant suggestions. Her response time was great and directions very clear and helpful. We will definitely stay here again. Thank you Rhiannon for making our stay in Calgary comfortable!",
      "Apartment was clean and as shown. Air conditioning was not working upon arrival, no one came to fix until the 4th out of 5th day I was there. <br/>Host messaged me at 1:30 am upon my arrival stating I\u2019d unplugged a noise detector (I thought it was a speaker and borrowed charging block) and asked me to plug it back in. That felt excessive and made me uneasy.",

That felt excessive and made me uneasy.",

We had it serviced twice during their visit, but unfortunately couldn\u2019t improve its performance further.  As for the noise detector, we simply asked the guest to plug it back in at his earliest convenience. This is just a a measure of security that we apply to all guests. In the end the guest expressed their frustration and requested a partial refund, which we agreed to provide as a gesture of goodwill. We always aim to be responsive and fair, even when facing unexpected circumstances."

      "Had a great stay at Clint and Diana\u2019s place for a girls weekend. It was the perfect size for four girls and very close to many bars in the city. Having a parking spot for this area of the city is also a great benefit. Clint and Diana were also very responsive as hosts. Would definitely recommend/stay here again.",
      "So, Clint and Diana were very nice and super responsive, the place was clean and nothing was broken. <br/>However, there wasn\u2019t enough toilet paper or paper towels, No BBQ utensils, and only one key to get in and out of the building.<br/>Lastly the pool was completely misleading. <br/>Super small, and didn\u2019t get really any sun.",
      "Very clear videos on how check In and anything you may need help with during your stay. The apartment was beautiful and very comfortable. Quality furniture and linens. The building itself felt secure and safe. The pool was great for the kids to swim. Overall very happy with our stay, only downside was that the parking space is VERY tight for any larger vehicles .. we have a Toyota sienna van and ended up paying for parking at the Impark parking lot just across the street (no biggie it was very close) but just a heads up to anyone with a larger vehicle it might not fit.",
      "Perfect stay complete with stunning views, ultra luxurious decor, quiet and secure building, access to a heated pool and fitness room, full kitchen and laundry, and walkable to all downtown attractions and activities! From the moment we booked, Clint and Diana were warm and welcoming, quick to respond, flexible, and ensured we had everything we need. We can\u2019t wait to come back and stay here again! \u2764\ufe0f",
      "If all AirBnBs were this clean, cozy and easy to navigate as a rental there would be no place for hotels ever again. Great hosts, that were quick to respond and offered suggestions regarding local amenities, as I wasn\u2019t familiar with the city. Beautiful space! Bedding is a huge deal for me and everything was top notch quality and comfort. I couldn\u2019t be happier.",
      "Clint and Diana\u2019s place is perfect for a stay in downtown Calgary. They are both really great to work with, they made check in seamless and had some really helpful videos to walk you through the process. Their apartment is gorgeous and well appointed with everything one would need for an evening dining in. I highly recommend their place for a stay In Calgary",
      "Clint and Diana were very helpful, the check-in instructions even involved videos which I appreciated. The condo is bright and cheerful with beautiful views of Calgary and the mountains in the distance. We didn\u2019t have any trouble getting to where we needed to go, it\u2019s really central. <br/>The kitchen is well equipped, the couch is per for looking out at the city with a beverage and the balcony is a really nice place to relax. The beds are comfortable, the sheets are soft and the pillows were not too hard or too soft. <br/>All around a very enjoyable visit.",
      "This downtown location is hard to beat and being on the 17th floor you get views of the mountains in the distance from the balcony. it was so nice to have a balcony with a bbq to use in the evening for cooking super as well as the two chairs provided on the balcony as well.",
      "Great location, walkable, close to public transport, market and good restaurants. Recommended for travelers who like to explore\u2026Great views to the west, secure building with amenities listed; would return on another visit to Calgary!",
      "We had a great stay  and would have been happy to  stay longer. Clean bright stylish accommodation with all the facilities we could need. Good city views.   Communication was great and all the instructions were very clear. Good location and plenty of eating places nearby plus a good size supermarket Parking space included and was a good size. If you need parking for a large truck there areseveral parking lots nearby. We would have no hesitation at staying again.",
      "Great cozy little condo that is well maintained and super functional.  Comfy beds and well stocked. Super building security. Walkable to 17th and downtown. Clint was very responsive and accommodating!  Didn\u2019t have chance to try pool but it looked good.  Would definitely stay again.",
      "The condo was the perfect location for everything we needed downtown. It was well taken care of, clean, and relaxing. Check in and out process was very clear and easy. We would stay again.",
      "When we arrived at this Airbnb it smelled strongly of cigarette smoke. I contacted the hosts and while they said they could not smell any cigarette smoke, they were very responsive bringing us an air purifier. While I did appreciate they tried to remedy the situation and left some chocolates the place still smelled smokey for our stay.<br/>The apartment was clean, had great views, coffee and a well stocked kitchen  but it was very tight for three women. The sofa bed was very hard, and there were no sheets for it. There were some pillows in the closet but there were no pillowcases. So instead of each of us being able to have her own sleeping space we had to double up and share a bed which was not preferable. <br/>The listing stated there is body soap and a bidet but there was not. I think this place has potential but it needs to be accurately listed and guests should set their expectations for a small place that would be good for two adults and maybe some small children.",
      "We enjoyed our stay.  Super quiet and comfortable.  Great location.",
      "It was a great location for downtown Calgary. Also, the bed was sooooo comfy!",
      "Enjoyed our stay, beautiful condo; lots of natural lighting and more.",
      "One of the best experience we had with Airbnb ever very kind people and the place is awesome",
      "Convenient location! The place was clean. The kitchen was well stocked. The expectations for check out cleaning was difficult as there was not cleaning products.",
      "Clint and Diana were wonderful hosts and we loved being close to excellent restaurants and shopping. Thank you!",
      "Very clear guide lines! Absolutely loved the stay at their gorgeous condo. Clint was very responsive and even tried to get us an early checkin. Highly recommend!",
      "If I come back to Calgary, I will definitely book same place",
      "Very nice apartment with a great view of the city. We will stay there again next time",
      "Great location. Clean comfortable space!",
      "Great hosts. The detailed instructions were very helpful."

        "host_response": "Thank you for your feedback. We\u2019re glad you enjoyed your stay and found us to be communicative. To clarify, guests are provided with two access devices, as the parkade remote also works for building entry in addition to the fob, apologies if that wasn\u2019t clear. We\u2019ll also ensure BBQ utensils, paper towels, and toilet paper are fully replenished, as we pride ourselves on keeping the unit well stocked. The pool size and layout are shown in our photos, though we understand it may have felt different in person. We\u2019re not sure the times you were at the pool; however, the deck typically enjoys sun until mid- afternoon. We always want our guests to feel comfortable & at home, and we\u2019re happy to keep making each stay even better than the last. Take good care and we welcome you back anytime."

The building itself felt secure and safe. The pool was great for the kids to swim. Overall very happy with our stay, only downside was that the parking space is VERY tight for any larger vehicles .. we have a Toyota sienna van and ended up paying for parking at the Impark parking lot just across the street (no biggie it was very close) but just a heads up to anyone with a larger vehicle it might not fit.",
        "host_response": "Thank you so much for your kind note! We\u2019re so glad you found the check-in easy, the unit comfortable. The pool fun is always a hit with the kids. We appreciate your note about the parking space - vans & larger vehicles can be a tighter fit, and your tip will be helpful for future guests. We\u2019re happy the nearby lot worked out conveniently.  We\u2019d love to welcome you back anytime!"

I contacted the hosts and while they said they could not smell any cigarette smoke, they were very responsive bringing us an air purifier. While I did appreciate they tried to remedy the situation and left some chocolates the place still smelled smokey for our stay.<br/>The apartment was clean, had great views, coffee and a well stocked kitchen  but it was very tight for three women. The sofa bed was very hard, and there were no sheets for it. There were some pillows in the closet but there were no pillowcases. So instead of each of us being able to have her own sleeping space we had to double up and share a bed which was not preferable. <br/>The listing stated there is body soap and a bidet but there was not. I think this place has potential but it needs to be accurately listed and guests should set their expectations for a small place that would be good for two adults and maybe some small children.",
        "host_response": "Thank you for your feedback. We\u2019re glad you enjoyed the views, coffee and appreciated our efforts with the air purifier & treats. While we didn\u2019t notice any cigarette smoke ourselves - even after checkout - we trust your experience and hope the purifier helped ensure clean air for your stay. Bedding (duvet, sheets, & pillow with pillowcase) for the sofa bed can be found inside the sofa storage itself. Since bedding is such an important detail we\u2019ll be sure to highlight this for future guests; however, we wish you had reached out - just as you did about the smoke - as it would have been a quick and simple fix to let you know where to find it. The square footage & floor plan are included in our listing so guests can ensure the space fits their needs, and we\u2019ve corrected an oversight in the amenities list (bidet) to keep everything accurate moving forward. All the best with your future travels."

It was homey, spacious, clean, and had all the amenities you need for a very comfortable space.<br/>Andrea, who I was in touch with throughout the trip was also very easy to communicate with and was really helpful whenever we ran into issues with the place.<br/>But what I loved most about this place was its location\u2014quiet, but close enough to all the activity in the city.<br/>Overall a 10/10 experience and will definitely book this place should I find myself back in Calgary.",

Highly recommend!",

We were able to walk to dinner and come back and enjoy our private space back in the condo. Highly recommended!",

The room was cozy and felt very comfortable for my husband and me.<br/>ONE TIP: <br/>The condo is located on the 21st floor, so be prepared to wait for the elevator. If you are not renting a car, consider calling your Uber once you arrive in the lobby.  Uber drivers are readily available around the building and typically arrive in under 3 minutes.  Thank you, Franny, for a wonderful stay!",

If you are not renting a car, consider calling your Uber once you arrive in the lobby.  Uber drivers are readily available around the building and typically arrive in under 3 minutes.

      "Misbah and Zubi were extremely prompt with communication, which I appreciated for a last minute stay. Place was well cleaned, well decorated and the kitchen is well stocked with kitchen utensils if you plan on cooking. Neighbourhood is perfect for quick access to downtown Calgary, and the apartment is very quiet despite being close to the action.",
      "Hosts were very friendly and responsive.  They accommodated with a late check out. The space was just a clean as all the pictures and located in a perfect area of downtown Calgary.  Would definitely stay here again 10/10.",
      "My daughter had an extended stay here while she did a co-op term.  She had early mornings and late nights and always felt safe walking to and from downtown.  The couple of minor issues that she had were addressed right away.",
      "Great location. Would stay here again for sure! Hosts are very responsive and place was clean.",
      "Great space, well worth the money! Didn\u2019t bother me, BUT there is a train that runs pretty close by (you can see it)\u2026 so a train horn might wake you up",
      "Great place to stay. In the very centre of Calgary, but still in a quiet area. Good pubs and restaurants within walking distance.",
      "Great location. I stayed 2 weeks for work.. does get loud outside late at night..people leaving the bars. people above partied alot on the balcony...but has nothing to do with the hosts. The hosts were great to communicate with and helped make my stay comfortable. Deep bathtub so was good for an enjoyable soak. I would stay here again if they had space. Building is secure and I felt safe.",
      "Host is willing to accommodate what has to be done for a comfortable stay.  Communicate  and you shall receive.",
      "We had a great stay in Calgary! Misbah and Zubi were very responsive and helpful with anything we needed. The apartment was very nice and walkable to everything you needed in the city. We definitely recommend and would come back!",
      "Mishap and Zubi were so helpful, quick with their responses and gave clear instructions with pictures on how to get into the apartment. I had such a comfortable stay with the full kitchen, washer and dryer and nice view of downtown. I would definitely stay here again when visiting Calgary.",
      "Enjoyed our stay, being in downtown everything was in walking distance.",
      "Great spot! Very cute building",
      "We had a great stay at Misbah and Zubi\u2019s 1-bedroom apartment in downtown Calgary. We visited during a cold spell, with temperatures ranging from -1 to -5\u00b0F, so it was definitely chilly, but we knew what we were getting into. The apartment itself is in a fantastic location\u2014super close to shopping, great restaurants, and easy access to the train, which made it really convenient for getting around.<br/>The space was modern, clean, and well-kept. My two young kids slept on the sofa bed, and honestly, it was more comfortable than I expected. They had no issues sleeping, which is always a win! The only thing I\u2019d mention is that the bed in the main bedroom was a bit too firm for my liking. It wasn\u2019t a huge deal for our short stay, but if we\u2019d been there longer, I might\u2019ve struggled a bit with comfort.<br/>Misbah and Zubi were excellent hosts\u2014easy to communicate with, responsive, and just genuinely friendly. They made everything smooth and hassle-free.<br/>Overall, it was a wonderful experience!",
      "We loved it! Super close and accessible to downtown Calgary and nice cozy place. Only an hour and a half from banff. Will definitely be coming back in the future!",
      "The hosts were great and responsive, the address was wrong on there listing but they were very quick to respond and correct the error. This is not there fault but the unit was very shabbily put together as there was a big sliding glass door that was currently fallen off the track and could hurt someone. Lots of double sided tape hangers all over the walls with nothing hanging from them. Lots of grubby mirrors on the walls and a very drafty patio door. Again I don\u2019t blame the hosts but the developer that built the unit used sub par trades. The bedroom is very small and I didn\u2019t like the idea that the guest should clean and put away dishes because how do you know the person before you did a good job. They should ask you put dishes in the dishwasher and have a cleaner do the rest to insure cleanliness. There cleaning demands did not match the quality of the unit. If your a younger person this would be a fine place to stay but for my wife and small child we were disappointed.",
      "This is a safe and secure condo building.The condo is clean and comfortable.We liked the pool and games room.We would book this again in the future, we also loved the underground parking spot.If I had anything to add,it would be a shelf or cupboard in the bathroom for the lady's toiletries.Misbah was very quick to answer any of our questions.",
      "Nice place, well equipped kitchen, very clean. Unfortunately located beside inner city bottle depot and near busy train tracks so was noisy with lots of homeless people in neighborhood. Building itself was pretty nice but many noisy guests/occupants. Hosts very responsive and communicative but a bit of confusion with check in instructions. Overall pretty nice place but maybe better suited for younger guests who don\u2019t mind noise so much.",
      "Want to thank Misbah and Zubi for being wonderful hosts and loved staying here!! The extra towels, pillows and little touches were very much appreciated!<br/>Misbah and Zubi are amazing and were so responsive, friendly and kind!! I had a situation where I needed to adjust my check-in and they were very kind and accommodating and I appreciate it so very much!!<br/>Loved staying here and you will too!<br/>Thank you Misbah and Zubi!!",
      "The apartment and location was beautiful, the host was very friendly and helped me with organising a place to stay last minute. The only downside was that there was a slight few issues I encountered in the apartment and when I reached out to the host afterwards to let them know, I never received a reply.",
      "We had such a great stay, the apartment has a lot of concrete which makes it super quiet which we loved. The city views from the balcony were also super pretty. They made sure everything was super clean and nice for our arrival and we were able to drop our stuff off early while the cleaner was still there which took a lot of stress off. We hope to visit again soon!",
      "thank you for you cooperation and services",
      "Great place and great view",
      "The hosts were great!  The building was very secure and the condo was really nice.  The location was fantastic!  We would definitely stay there again.  Thank you so much, Misbah and Zubi!!",
      "Amazing place! The hosts were very responsive and attentive! Just a thing to keep in mind, there is a coffee maker but no filters, but the location is amazing so you have safeway 5 min away, as well as a Tim\u2019s, but overall is a great place and very central"

We visited during a cold spell, with temperatures ranging from -1 to -5\u00b0F, so it was definitely chilly, but we knew what we were getting into. The apartment itself is in a fantastic location\u2014super close to shopping, great restaurants, and easy access to the train, which made it really convenient for getting around.<br/>The space was modern, clean, and well-kept. My two young kids slept on the sofa bed, and honestly, it was more comfortable than I expected. They had no issues sleeping, which is always a win! The only thing I\u2019d mention is that the bed in the main bedroom was a bit too firm for my liking. It wasn\u2019t a huge deal for our short stay, but if we\u2019d been there longer, I might\u2019ve struggled a bit with comfort.<br/>Misbah and Zubi were excellent hosts\u2014easy to communicate with, responsive, and just genuinely friendly. They made everything smooth and hassle-free.<br/>Overall, it was a wonderful experience!",

This is not there fault but the unit was very shabbily put together as there was a big sliding glass door that was currently fallen off the track and could hurt someone. Lots of double sided tape hangers all over the walls with nothing hanging from them. Lots of grubby mirrors on the walls and a very drafty patio door. Again I don\u2019t blame the hosts but the developer that built the unit used sub par trades. The bedroom is very small and I didn\u2019t like the idea that the guest should clean and put away dishes because how do you know the person before you did a good job. They should ask you put dishes in the dishwasher and have a cleaner do the rest to insure cleanliness. There cleaning demands did not match the quality of the unit. If your a younger person this would be a fine place to stay but for my wife and small child we were disappointed.",

      "The location cannot be beat.  you're surrounded by so many good restaurants that is within walking distance.<br/>The apartment was super clean and we appreciated it.  We were grateful that there was also a washer and dryer in the unit which helps immensely especially when you have little ones.  <br/>we'd definitely stay again should we ever visit Calgary a second time.",
      "Fantastic location\u2026walkable to concert at the Saddledome, lots of great restaurants and amenities just steps away and easily walkable to shopping downtown or on 17 Avenue. Loved our time here!",
      "Amanda\u2019s condo is in our favourite Beltline building but this was our first time staying in her unit, it will be our future go to! Her place is so clean, beautiful view and she is so friendly! My daughter forgot her computer and she messaged us right away and helped us make arrangements to get it returned to us. We were there for three nights and never used our car, everything is so close. Great big bathrooms with lots of counter space, comfy beds & couch, free Netflix. The units in this building are practically soundproof too which is lovely.",
      "City Centre Suite is right on the beltline a short walk from BMO and the Stampede grounds. Everything was well thought out and the Nespresso coffee was awesome. The view at night of the city is beautiful and the place is just like the photos. Highly recommend!",
      "We had a stress free incredible stay. So many options for food and entertainment right outside the door. Very clean and had everthing we required. The host was attentive to any messages and easy to deal with. Highly reccomend you stay here!!",
      "This apartment is pristine - immaculate design, open plan, beautiful balcony. Plenty of space & privacy. The building is secure & easy to find/access. Plenty of food in the area and easy access to public transport. Kids playground across the street with plenty of squirrels & a resident large rabbit. The apartment was a great base to explore the city & a nice place to rest after a long day. Quality coffee machine and washer/dryer facilities were a great addition",
      "Great location in the city! Close by lots of things to do, plenty of restaurants and coffee shops. Even though we had our car, we walked most of the time. Spacious apartment with a good view outside.",
      "Amanda\u2019s condo was great! It was clean, free of clutter, perfect location and most importantly for us it was kid friendly. Made travelling with our son significantly easier. I lf we ever find ourselves in Calgary again, I would 100% stay here again.",
      "Terrible host: I texted already about the time I will reach (11 pm), and when I reached I called for access and their was no response  \ud83d\ude11.  In midnight I was left stranded with my baby and family and lot of stress. I have to go to hotel and due this all this hasel my next went bad due to lack of sleep. Airbnb staff helped me on call to tackle as best as possible.",
      "The apartment was great, centrally located. We were two different parties in the apartment so we appreciated having two bathrooms. Definitely a perk of the place, along with the great view. The building wad quiet as well. <br/>Amanda was very responsive and all questions were answered in a timely manner.",
      "Calgary Stampede Stay<br/>We stayed at Amanda\u2019s apartment as two couples before we set off on a road trip and found the location great. It was very handy for the stampede but also for some great bars and restaurants. We did a street art and beer tour and despite it raining the entire time we had a great time. The directions to access the apartment were spot on and communication was first rate. We would definitely recommend staying here.",
      "We loved Amanda\u2019s BnB. Great location! So many neat little shops nearby - bakery, coffee, markets, etc. as well as quick access to 8th avenue pedestrian street. <br/>Enjoyed the bright and airy open concept living room/kitchen. The patio was an added bonus! <br/>Beds were comfortable, space was very quiet, and having 2 bathrooms were a bonus. <br/>Highly recommend, and we will look it up again if we\u2019re visiting Calgary.",
      "Good location for what our needs were. Area is a bit \u201csketchy \u201c depending on where you walked. Bed linens were adequate with terrible pillows. Bedroom with ensuite has no windows so felt like you were in a dungeon with 4 of us staying in the unit. No paper towels/napkins, no Kleenex, any extras were non existent. Washcloths had long black hair left in them from previous patrons.",
      "Amanda\u2019s place was perfect for our stay in Calgary for a wedding. Her place was spacious, clean, and the kitchen had everything we needed! The robes and slippers were also a nice added touch!",
      "We had a great time in Calgary! The location is awesome and near to lots of nice bars/restaurants and in a very walkable neighborhood. The instructions for check-in were super clear and the apt is spacious",
      "I stayed here with a friend for three nights for a conference. Place is beautiful and well appointed. The bedrooms are big for a condo and there\u2019s two full bathrooms, which was nice. The only criticism I have is the building itself. There\u2019s not a lot of soundproofing between units, so we could hear everything that was going on upstairs. People were having loud parties until 3 AM and we could hear if they dropped something on the floor. It was quite loud With almost no soundproofing and kept us up at night. Other than that, great place to stay.",
      "Great place to stay, reasonable and good location. Would highly recommend this place to someone else",
      "Very comfortable, beautiful unit. Area was a little sketchy to walk around at night but during the day is lively with many great restaurants and very walkable.",
      "Loved the location.  Perfect for everything we planned to do over the weekend and we were able to walk.",
      "beautiful stay, her recommendations for places and food in a book provided we\u2019re all great. Definitely recommend Native Tongue & Beltliner for anyone looking to stay in the future. Balcony had amazing views favourite morning sunrise spot during stay. So close to lots to do downtown. A great stay 10/10",
      "Nice apartment with a great view in a perfect spot. Will certainly come back!",
      "Great stay \u2014 simple check-in, very clean, and perfect location.",
      "The place is great, super comfortable, clean, and centrally located. Amanda was very friendly. I would definitely stay here again and recommend it 100%.",
      "Amanda\u2019s Airbnb is lovely, clean, cosy, in a great location and lets in so much natural light. Would recommend and would happily stay here again. Thank you!"

The bedrooms are big for a condo and there\u2019s two full bathrooms, which was nice. The only criticism I have is the building itself. There\u2019s not a lot of soundproofing between units, so we could hear everything that was going on upstairs. People were having loud parties until 3 AM and we could hear if they dropped something on the floor. It was quite loud With almost no soundproofing and kept us up at night. Other than that, great place to stay.",

Our building has just enforced the use of noise meters, so those are currently being installed in hopes we can limit this type of disruption.

      "This place was in a great location, was as in the pictures, beds were comfortable and check in/out instructions were great. The only downfall was that the place was not clean and a note to the hosts regarding this was not answered. I spent some time cleaning on arrival but there was no mops etc for me to clean the floors. Windows had handprints all over them, crumbs on tables, floors were dirty, dusting hadn\u2019t been done in some time and oven was unusable due to amount of burnt food/grease stains inside. Would have been a 5/5 if clean.",
      "We loved our stay. I particularly enjoyed looking out at the beautiful city lights and looking at all the beautiful buildings. We were close to everything Safeway Starbucks every kind of restaurant you can think of in a movie theater. Our house even let us use their parking spot in a double gated parking garage with security doors, even into the building. We never felt unsafe. Sitting on the balcony was relaxing and really enhanced our Calgary experience. I would come back here in a heartbeat.",
      "Wonderful stay! The place was spotless, stylish, and very comfortable- exactly as shown in the photos. The host was responsive, and made everything super easy. Great location too. View from balcony was spectacular! Highly recommend \ud83d\udc4d",
      "This place was clean and conveniently located for my trip to Calgary. It is in the heart of downtown and near train tracks so it is noisy at all times of day, but was to be expected for the location. The balcony was particularly nice with panoramic city views.",
      "Host were gracious and accommodating. Responsive <br/>It's in a great location. The building is close to amenities <br/>Nothing you can do but that side of the building is a bit noisy. With doors closed all fine but can't really enjoy the great balcony and sunset view <br/>It's a good not and accommodated 2  couples. Good size unit. <br/>Not a 5 star clean however the hosts were responsive <br/>Overall, it is a good spot for a short stay",
      "This flat was in a great location - walkable to all the downtown areas. Great coffee shops and restaurants nearby. Great views of downtown and the Calgary tower from the flat. It was pretty quiet inside even though the trains came through downtown during the night. The hosts were fantastic with great instructions, communication and fast responses. Highly recommend.",
      "Our super late check in was no issue had multiple units with a group in building. Parkade was big enough for a full size wagoneer no issue. (Even though we parked in wrong spot building was helpful and understanding everyone friendly front to back.",
      "I had a wonderful 4-day stay at this Calgary apartment. From the moment I arrived, it felt welcoming and comfortable, providing the perfect balance of convenience and tranquility. With the doors closed, the space was incredibly quiet, allowing for restful nights and relaxing downtime. While the nearby train could be heard when the windows or balcony doors were open, it was never intrusive and didn\u2019t affect my stay. The kitchen was a standout feature\u2014fully equipped with everything I needed, from utensils and cookware to plates and glasses. The balcony was a lovely bonus, perfect for morning coffee or evening relaxation, adding a touch of outdoor enjoyment. The host was responsive and accommodating, providing clear instructions and ensuring a smooth check-in & check-out process.  I would highly recommend this property to anyone visiting Calgary and would happily return on future trips.",
      "We had a wonderful stay at Misbah and Zubi\u2019s place. The view was amazing and felt secure even though it\u2019s located downtown. The place itself was really great with enough space for 4-6 guests at a time. Fully functional kitchen plus air conditioning. Both beds are comfortable plus they have extra blankets (and towels) for the hide-in bed in the living room. Other than that, the place is accurately described in the listing. <br/>Misbah and Zubi are both responsive and helpful in accommodating our requests when I reached out. I brought up the issue that some of the knives are rusty and they said they will be replacing them soon.<br/>They also provided detailed information on getting to the place and in locating the parkade underground. <br/>Highly recommend this AirBnb to anyone looking for a great place to stay. I would love to book this place again in the future!",
      "Amazing Airbnb! One of the best I\u2019ve stayed in by far. The location was amazing downtown and walkable to everything I needed to do for my trip. Secure and safe parking was a bonus. The unit was clean, had everything I needed and the most comfortable bed!! Very quiet and couldn\u2019t even hear anything outside. Host was very responsive and accommodating to my plans and schedule. So worth the price and would definitely stay again.",

Windows had handprints all over them, crumbs on tables, floors were dirty, dusting hadn\u2019t been done in some time and oven was unusable due to amount of burnt food/grease stains inside.

With the doors closed, the space was incredibly quiet, allowing for restful nights and relaxing downtime. While the nearby train could be heard when the windows or balcony doors were open, it was never intrusive and didn\u2019t affect my stay. The kitchen was a standout feature\u2014fully equipped with everything I needed, from utensils and cookware to plates and glasses. The balcony was a lovely bonus, perfect for morning coffee or evening relaxation, adding a touch of outdoor enjoyment. The host was responsive and accommodating, providing clear instructions and ensuring a smooth check-in & check-out process.  I would highly recommend this property to anyone visiting Calgary and would happily return on future trips.",

The place itself was really great with enough space for 4-6 guests at a time. Fully functional kitchen plus air conditioning. Both beds are comfortable plus they have extra blankets (and towels) for the hide-in bed in the living room. Other than that, the place is accurately described in the listing. <br/>Misbah and Zubi are both responsive and helpful in accommodating our requests when I reached out. I brought up the issue that some of the knives are rusty and they said they will be replacing them soon.<br/>They also provided detailed information on getting to the place and in locating the parkade underground. <br/>Highly recommend this AirBnb to anyone looking for a great place to stay.

      "Fantastic location with so much to do right at your doorstep. Close to tons of bars and restaurants. Building and area felt safe. Instructions were clear and easy to use to access the unit. Free parking was a bonus. When we arrived the tub was leaking and progressively got worse over the weekend but Selase was quick to respond and send someone out to fix it as soon as we asked. Would definitely recommend this home!",
      "Great location with excellent restaurants across the street. 10 min walk to downtown. Easy to drive everywhere. VERY responsive hosts. Most complete kitchen at an Airbnb. Lots of clean linens. Most importantly we would stay there again. I left an item in the condo, they reached out and within 30 minutes we had a plan in place to get the item to our home in Burlington. Amazing",
      "Our stay at Selase\u2019s condo was excellent! We really appreciated all the informations and instructions ahead of time- this made parking and getting into the condo a breeze. Everything was spotless, comfortable, and the location was ideal for a short but sweet stay in Calgary! I would certainly recommend this listing.",
      "Clean and beautiful apartment. A bit dark at night, but still comfy. <br/>The check-in instruction is a bit difficult to understand. But the host was very proactive and responsive, he answered our question in minute making that not a big problem.<br/>In general, we love this place. Recommended!!",
      "We had a great stay at Selase\u2019s. The place was clean and comfortable. Great location - coffee shop across the street. Easily walkable to everywhere we wanted to go - or if not, many Ubers available within minutes. Very nice view of Calgary. We enjoyed our stay!",
      "Selase\u2019s condo was great! So close to many things we wanted to see and do. Walkable to many restaurants around town! The view from the balcony is wonderful- especially at night when watching the Calgary Tower lights change! <br/>Super clean apartment and all the amenities you need. Would recommend Selase\u2019s place to anyone that wants to stay in downtown Calgary! Thanks so much!",
      "We had a lovely stay here, the apartment is big and has everything you need. The location is fantastic with restaurants, breakfast places, bars and pubs all around. It's also really easy to walk from there to downtown. The skyline view from the living room is really special! We would totally stay again next time we are in Calgary!",
      "Wonderful place to stay in the downtown area. Nice view and easy to get to most places in downtown or around the city. The rooms and amenities were just as described, and this made the stay wonderful for us. Selase was very quick to respond anytime we had a question about the place or city. Definitely recommend this place!",
      "Our stay here was wonderful! The AirBNB feels very safe and is in a fantastic location. Our host was amazing and was so responsive to all of our questions. It was spotless and very cozy as well, plus it had an incredible view of the city! We would absolutely stay here again!",
      "Highly recommend Selase\u2019s place for a safe, comfortable and convenient stay in Calgary downtown. The condo was clean and equipped with all the essentials (and extra). Selase and Brionnae were kind to frequently check in with us during our stay and restocked what was needed asap.",
      "Would stay here again.  Only issue we had was with check-in.  We weren't able to connect with the host through the intercom system after several tries.  Thankfully, another resident let us in and we were able to get situated.  Check in and parking instructions were clear once we got past that issue.<br/>Amazing downtown views with several good restaurants nearby.  Loved the patio and spent much of our downtime outside.  Everything was as-pictured in the listing.  <br/>Would recommend!",
      "Fantastic host, was very responsive and nothing was a problem. excellent location close proximity to shops and restuarants.<br/>would highly recommend",
      "Salese\u2019s condo is perfect for a relaxing stay in Calgary. Whether you\u2019re there for two days or a week the location is perfect. Across the street from fantastic restaurants and pubs as well as extremely walkable to downtown, shopping is also close by. The building is clean, modern and quiet. We will stay here again on our next visit to Calgary.",
      "Great place walkable distance to lots of places and amazing balcony view",
      "Excellent host and giving very good and explicit directions and resources. Would definitely stay again.... paid premium because of 15,000 Rotarians being in town. We loved all the grocery store and restaurant and food court options in the area. Felt safe.... I'm not a lover of parking ramps so didn't like the upward First climb or I'll quickly the garage door shuts but understand it and super appreciated having the parking space and the freedom to be able to drive to the mountains and come back at night and have a parking space. One night was super cold and my mother was very appreciative of the chicken noodle soup he provided in the cupboard. I loved the coffee syrup every morning. Very comfortable!!! Great skyline view day or night! And very walkable to the Saddledome and BMO Center. Loved his checking in mid-stay and then reminder of how to check out and what to do. Always seemed very reachable and responsive.",
      "The place is very clean, walking distance to our venue in BMO Centre. The host is easy to communicate. I will stay again if its available during our next events. Thank you very much.",
      "Great furnished condo . The owner was very friendly and we had a great time in the  apartment .  Lots of places to visit in downtown area or to eat/drink nearby including pubs or a Starbucks downstairs. The condo is fully furnished with good quality furniture, very clean and has everything you need. However I strongly not recommend anyone to go outside after 11 pm as the area could be crowded with lots of weird people. Otherwise I recommend this booking as a 5 star one.",
      "If you\u2019re looking for a place that truly feels like home, this is it! The attention to detail, cozy atmosphere, and thoughtful touches throughout the space make it stand out. Everything was spotless, the location was perfect, and the host was incredibly accommodating and responsive. It\u2019s clear they go above and beyond to ensure guests have the best possible stay. Highly recommend to anyone looking for comfort, convenience, and a touch of luxury. Can\u2019t wait to return!",

We loved all the grocery store and restaurant and food court options in the area. Felt safe.... I'm not a lover of parking ramps so didn't like the upward First climb or I'll quickly the garage door shuts but understand it and super appreciated having the parking space and the freedom to be able to drive to the mountains and come back at night and have a parking space. One night was super cold and my mother was very appreciative of the chicken noodle soup he provided in the cupboard. I loved the coffee syrup every morning. Very comfortable!!! Great skyline view day or night! And very walkable to the Saddledome and BMO Center. Loved his checking in mid-stay and then reminder of how to check out and what to do.

      "Great service from our host Kyle to access the condo, he is very proactive with instructions and very accommodating.<br/>The condo was very clean and had more than enough kitchen supplies. <br/>This location is a short walk to downtown and surrounded also by great restaurants and bars. <br/>We will be repeat guests.",
      "We had a wonderful stay at Kyle\u2019s and Andrew\u2019s Airbnb! The space was clean, comfortable, and exactly as described. Kyle and Andrew were excellent communicators and provided help whenever needed for a great experience. The location was perfect as it was close to everything in downtown. I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a relaxing and hassle-free stay!",
      "We especially enjoyed the view and the location!<br/>The apartment is well equipped. It does not match the pictures exactly but it is very similar. Only the furniture is a little different (different couch, table and chairs). <br/>The hosts are very responsive. We had an issue with a window and informed the hosts late in the evening. On the next day around noon the handyman already fixed it.",
      "We had a lovely stay! Great views, clean, easy to check in and out and just perfect for our weekend stay!",
      "Amazing location within walking distance of the Flames game and so many delicious restaurants. The hosts give clear and thorough instructions for your stay and complimentary parking! Would definitely stay again in future visits to Calgary!",
      "Nice flat in a great location. All good.",
      "Fabulous property in a great location. We would stay here every time we visit Calgary.",
      "Great place to stay in Calgary!",
      "Really great location, would book again!!",
      "Great location and lovely unit.",
      "Amazing location! Great place! Had the best time!",
      "Kyle and Andrew are fantastic hosts. Proactive with all communication and check ins. The condo was lovely and had everything we needed. Would definitely stay again \ud83d\ude42",
      "The stay was great! Was exactly like the pictures and in a great location. Kyle was very quick to respond and checked in. I would stay again, I highly recommend.",
      "Great Host !!! Very quick to respond... Good 1 Bedroom Den to stay in, Great Location, and Great hosts Andrew and Kyle !!!",
      "Very walkable into the city centre. Beds were extremely comfortable and it was very quiet. Kitchen had everything needed to cook- there\u2019s a Safeway not too far.",
      "Tidy apartment, nice location",
      "Amazing place! Kyle and Andrew were very helpful during the stay.",
      "Very safe and secure condo. Beautiful views of the city.",
      "This place is in a great location!! It is near good restaurants & bars so a bit noisy at night on the weekend with the bedroom window open. The beds were comfortable & the kitchen well stocked. Kyle gave prefect directions, provided easy access and was quick to respond to any questions.  The space was comfortable, good wifi, overall clean (floor carpets could use a cleaning) free parking spot is a bonus!  We would return.",
      "The apartment is exactly as shown in the images. The location was great and very close to restaurants. There is a small indoor food market across the road along with a great Indian place on the other side. The apartment was stored well with essentials and communication was great. I appreciated the washer and dryer combo in the apartment as it came in handy.",
      "Very clean place and it looks just like the photos. It felt like home and the area felt safe and cozy. If we had any inquiries Kyle and Andrew were quick to respond. I highly recommend staying here!<br/>The only thing that would make it absolutely perfect is if there was a lockbox to drop off the key fobs for those driving so that they don\u2019t have to go back into the building unit after they take the car out of the garage.",
      "Nice unit in a great location within walking distance of many restaurants and attractions. Kyle\u2019s instructions were very clear and he was very responsive, even proactive in asking how our stay was going and giving reminders about checkout.",
      "What a beautiful stay. The view at night was gorgeous and would highly recommend. Hosts were accommodating and responded quickly to make sure we had access and were checked in.",
      "Kyle was a great host! The place was awesome and in a great location to lots of great restaurants.  Plus, a Starbucks is literally right across the street.  We had an amazing time and would definitely return! Thanks!!"

      "I loved my stay! The apartment was spotless, very comfortable, and exactly as described in the listing. The location is perfect close to everything.The host was incredibly responsive and thoughtful. I would definitely stay here again!",
      "The location was excellent, with lots of great shopping and restaurants just a short walk away. The condo was very clean, and check-in was super easy. I would definitely stay again on a future trip to Calgary.",
      "Great location & walkable to everything you need in town. We liked the apartment, everything was as shown in the photos. <br/>There is air con but it\u2019s extremely loud, so we couldn\u2019t sleep with it on. Communication with the host could have been better but overall we enjoyed our stay.",
      "The location was perfect. A lot of pubs and restaurants for food. It was a cute little condo perfect for 1 or 2 people for a weekend away. The a/c is two portable units, which could be a bit noisy to some, but we have a fan running all night at home anyways so it didn't bother us and  just gave us the white noise. Would definitely stay again.",
      "Pros - good location, spacious, clean, well equipped, outside balcony is a bonus. <br/>Cons - the bedroom is so bright we had to wear eye masks all night every night. It's the only window in the apartment without a blind, which doesn't make sense, and has a very thin white curtain which basically does nothing. Even at night, there's a bright lamp directly outside, so it's always bright. Frustrating when having a dark place to sleep is a pretty basic requirement of accomodation. <br/>I also messaged, twice, for help or just advice on storing luggage before the flight and they just ignored my questions and instead just continued to send automated messages about checking out. Again, frustrating. Overall we would recommend despite this.",
      "Stayed at Virginias during my stay in Calgary, first time comer so didn\u2019t know the area too well before arrival- Virginia had recommendations to all her favourite places near by which help! Condo was clean and quiet! Definitely will be using Virginia\u2019s Airbnb next time I\u2019m in!",
      "Virginias place was in an amazing location and very well kept and cleaned. All necessities were there like coffee, cups, shampoo, etc",
      "Great location! Other reviews nicely capture the location / condition etc<br/>Good value for money for sure",
      "Great place to stay. Location had lots of places to eat nearby. The apartment itself was as described, very clean with lots of space for two people. Highly recommend!",
      "Great stay at this place, it was nice and spacious and clean. We had a fun stay. Virginia was very accommodating and responsive to our inquiries too. 10/10",
      "Great location for us and the time we spent at the MNP arena. Nice area with lots of restaurants.",
      "Amazing stay. Host checks in with you throughout the stay to make sure everything is well and comfortable. I will definitely book again next time!",
      "Great location! Lots to do nearby in terms of restaurants. Also a short walk to the river which was a lovely walk.<br/>Fabulous to have a parking spot too!",
      "Great location. Lots of walkable places. Cute place. Super responsive. <br/>I would come back!",
      "Love the mission neighborhood!  The apartment was a little warm, a tiny bit noisy and I would have loved some face cloths.   But aside from that I would definitely stay here again!",
      "Lots to enjoy at this unbeatable location with parking! This quiet spacious condo has all the amenities and the 24/7 convenience, restaurants,  grocery are footsteps away. Balcony included!  \ud83d\ude0e",
      "Was great to be back in Mission... only a couple blocks from where I lived my first 4 years in Calgary. The place was nicely decorated, with some personal flair. Great decorating. Have already recommended it to some friends.",
      "Virginia was excellent and the place was beautiful. It was like home!",

It's the only window in the apartment without a blind, which doesn't make sense, and has a very thin white curtain which basically does nothing. Even at night, there's a bright lamp directly outside, so it's always bright. Frustrating when having a dark place to sleep is a pretty basic requirement of accomodation. <br/>I also messaged, twice, for help or just advice on storing luggage before the flight and they just ignored my questions and instead just continued to send automated messages about checking out. Again, frustrating. Overall we would recommend despite this.",

      "Great apartment and location - personally like being near 4th and 17th for all the great restaurants and shops. Apartment exactly as shown. There were some issues with the master bathroom unexpectedly and the team was very responsive and offered a make good, which was much appreciated. <br/>Would recommend.",
      "I would highly recommend this place, the location is great, the apartment was very clean and super comfortable. The host is very helpful and responsive for any issues or concerns.",
      "We were very comfortable at the location and it was close to the things we wanted to do. They were very responsive throughout the entire rental. The unit was spotless and had all the amenities to make our stay feel like home.",
      "Great stay in a great location.  Lots to do right out your door.  Condo is spacious and comfortable, king bed very comfy other bed was ok.  Clean and comfortable and good price point.<br/>Thank you for the great stay",
      "This was a pleasant and secure place to stay as a group of four! The location was central and allowed us to explore the city, and the apartment was comfortable, with well-lit rooms (a big plus for doing hair and makeup)!",
      "Beth was really kind and accommodating. We arrived later than the check-in time, but she graciously stayed up to let us in. The building\u2019s buzzer wasn\u2019t working properly (a neighbor mentioned it had been having issues), but that was not Beth\u2019s fault and the clear instructions she provided made things easy once we got inside.<br/>The Airbnb itself is wonderful\u2014clean, uncluttered, and well-stocked with everything you might need. There is a top sheet and plenty of blankets in case it got chilly, which I appreciated. The bed and pillows are softer than I\u2019m used to, but that comes down to personal preference.<br/>Overall, it\u2019s a quiet, peaceful, and centrally located place that\u2019s very walkable and convenient. I\u2019d definitely stay here again.",
      "Perfect Airbnb for those wishing to be located close to great restaurants and central inner city Calgary exploring.  Communication was clear and fast, checking in and out was simple and the apartment was exactly as pictured! <br/>Would highly recommend!",
      "Amazing location! Close to 4th street & 17th ave. Packed with patios and great restaurants. Close to a gas station, grocery store etc. Has a great private patio for summer nights. Just down the road from Stampede grounds as well! Thank you, Beth!",
      "Had a good stay in Calgary. The condo proximity to first street market food hall and a kids playground was perfect! Everything was clean and worked great. Wonderful washer and dryer.<br/>Our only issue, and this is likely moot other times of the year, was the heat inside the apartment. When we arrived before 5pm the blinds had been open all day and it was 80F inside. The following evening it improved after keeping everything closed but it still impacted our ability to sleep comfortably. Would rebook here outside of summer months!",
      "Beth\u2019s place was perfect for our week-long stay to visit our daughter in Calgary (her sister came too) as we were one street behind her building! Lots of great coffee shops, restaurants nearby and downtown is just a few blocks away. The apartment was spacious, clean and having two bathrooms was perfect. Tastefully decorated, we took advantage of the large balcony with the beautiful, unseasonably warm weather for May. Communication was prompt and friendly and we were able to have any questions answered. We would definitely stay at Beth\u2019s place again. Thank you!",
      "Super clean spacious unit! Super awesome experience.  Beth was super responsive and accommodating!",
      "Beautiful condo, nicely decorated, great location. Easy walk to restaurants. Very responsive host to address any questions.",
      "The place was beautiful. Awesome having underground parking. Lots of places to walk to nearby!",
      "Lovely, comfortable apartment in a fantastic neighborhood in Calgary.  Many great restaurants, cocktail bars, and shops in easy walking distance.",
      "Beth and her team did a great job in making us feel welcome.  She was very responsive to any questions that I had and the condo was very quiet and clean.  The condo unit has two large bedroom and two 4 piece washroom with an ensuite washer and dryer which was perfect.  The unit was very clean and the bed were fantastic!   The actual location was perfect as it was a ten to fifteen minute walk to the downtown shopping and food district.  There was also a specialty grocery store about five minutes away and a large format Shoppers Drug Mart that carried a wide selection of groceries.<br/>There was also an Enterprise Car Rental about 10 minutes away if you need to rent a car.  <br/>The driving is very easy in Calgary and it took about 90 minutes to get to Banff. I would also recommend going to Drumheller for the dinosaur museum.<br/>I was impressed with Beth and her team and would stay there again.",
      "Our stay was wonderful, very spacious and with all the amenities you require. <br/>Easy instructions and a responsive host- would highly recommend.",
      "Over all the place was very clean and spacious! Great location and building. Two reasons I had specifically reserved this place because of the beautiful fireplace and free parking. The fireplace did not work and my vehicle did not fit in the underground parking. Boat did apologize but also indicated that they didn\u2019t put the fireplace place under the amenity list (just deceiving when you see the pictures). There also was no where to indicate the underground parking had limitations. With a roof rack I am under 7\u201d. Luckily I could shuffle around and get free steer parking since it was the long weekend. If these two \u201cmiscommunications\u201d with add did not occur my review would have been 5 stars.",
      "We stayed here last week for 6 nights & the apartment is so incredible! It was super clean & tidy, fully equipped with everything you need! All the  air b&b  staff were super helpful & accommodating. The apartment building itself is very safe & peaceful. You will just feel right at home here! I deffo would return here on my next trip to Calgary! Can\u2019t fault it at all.",
      "Great Apartment in downtown Calgary. The apartment was exactly as described and comfortable for 2 couples. Easy walking distance to restaurants and bars.<br/>Parking was really easy to find and was ample space for a Dodge Durango (just in case anyone is concerned about the parking space size. Overall a great apartment for our short stay.",
      "The apartment was very nice, however the building had many faults. Broken elevator, plumbing issues. The host was very responsive and accommodating.",
      "Great week spent at this cozy condo!  Terrific location and super responsive hosts.",
      "Fantastic place to stay, very responsive and helpful host.  Would absolutely stay here again!",
      "Great spot in a central location in Calgary! Very walkable to main bars/restaurants and AirBNB was exactly as pictured in the listing,",
      "We had a fabulous time at the rental. Easy walk to great restaurants. Building was safe and quiet."

There is a top sheet and plenty of blankets in case it got chilly, which I appreciated. The bed and pillows are softer than I\u2019m used to, but that comes down to personal preference.<br/>Overall, it\u2019s a quiet, peaceful, and centrally located place that\u2019s very walkable and convenient.

The actual location was perfect as it was a ten to fifteen minute walk to the downtown shopping and food district.  There was also a specialty grocery store about five minutes away and a large format Shoppers Drug Mart that carried a wide selection of groceries.<br/>There was also an Enterprise Car Rental about 10 minutes away if you need to rent a car.  <br/>The driving is very easy in Calgary and it took about 90 minutes to get to Banff.

There also was no where to indicate the underground parking had limitations. With a roof rack I am under 7\u201d.

      "Location and value are tremendous! Host Margarita met me upon arrival, showed me around the building -- including the beautiful views from the rooftop -- and followed up the next day with cafe recommendations for remote working. Consummate host, who checked in a few times during my 16-day stay, which I extended an extra week due to loving the area. Pics are accurate, top floor means quieter, neighborhood has 2 grocery stores two blocks away, and 17th Ave is less than a five minute walk to restaurants and shops galore. I walked to downtown as well as to the Saddledome to catch a Flames preseason game. Super walkable and easy to get around. I also rented a car for a few days and it was nice to have access to the parking garage in the building. I really enjoyed my stay in Calgary, and Margarita and her apartment were part of the reason. I would stay there again and highly recommend!",
      "Everything in general was well made and clear. <br/>The retrieval of the keys was simple and very clear, and we easily got into the room. <br/>The place was very nice like the pictures. The rooms and beds did not have any smell. There were many utensils, plates, kitchenware, and toilet ware available. The water pressure is very good, and the host was very accessible and responsive. <br/>The location of the place is very accessible to many different eateries, convenience stores, grocery stores and gas station. <br/>One of the only problems we had was that the elevator didn't work 2 times as the lift door did not open on the 'PH' level. We had to go up the stairs and ask someone from our room to open the door of the stairs into the 'PH' level for us (as it was locked). If not, we would not have been able to get back into our unit. <br/>All in all, it was a very good stay and would stay there again. Thanks for hosting us!",
      "This was our first stay at an AirBnB & we were lucky to have stayed at Margarita 's place. our interactions with her while we were deciding were helpful, she kept a check on us during our arrival and ensured the checkin was smooth & she met us, explained & answered all our queries. The place has everything you need & if you miss anything just ask Margarita. The building is well kept, no noise and peaceful. Overall the location is perfect, close to shopping marts & best of resturants & coffeeshops. we had a wonderful stay and felt at home. and yes, special shoutout to Margarita's partner Jose & family for the beautiful fruit basket for my family.<br/>if you are looking for a home away from home, this is the place.",
      "We had a nice stay. The appartment was very comfortable, well equipped and with a good wifi connection (we were able to work without issues). All kind the stores/restaurants nearby. As mentionned in other reviews, Margarita was indeed a great host, always ready to help and make our stay even better. We would definitely come back!",
      "Would recommend! I stayed for six nights, and was quite happy. Host was quick to respond and reached out to check in and make sure I was happy. Location was excellent, with 17th Ave a short distance away as well as a grocery store and drugstore if needed. Space was clean and well kept, and the shower pressure was excellent (a major point for me).<br/>Given the location and length of my stay, I was happy with the price point in comparison to other options in the same area.<br/>Only thing I will note is that if you are highly sensitive to sound from outside that it would be best to stay in the bedroom that does not have the AC unit. Earplugs would help with this, however. It was not enough of a concern for me, but worth mentioning. There was construction happening on the weekdays I was there, but given the location that is not unusual.",
      "Great value for location. Walkable to restaurants along 17th and close to the stampede grounds. Large space that works for a bigger group.",
      "It\u2019s a great, clean place to start exploring bustling SW Calgary. We had trouble getting into the parking garage but it was an issue outside of the owner\u2019s control. Plus, parking is free and abundant on weekends.",
      "Margarita, was a great host. We got in early and stayed an extra day. WiFi was top notch and a bonus we were able to bring our pet. Margarita was very responsive and I would highly recommend this listing.",
      "it was a very nice  place to stay, nothing much to complain about",
      "I really liked the apartment. Good location and in a quiet neighborhood not far from the city center and with quick access to the supermarket, market with bus stops and train stations. The apartment was perfect for me and my family. I really liked it. Margarita was always receptive and accessible and always responded to our messages and gave solutions to all our requests. I highly recommend his apartment to anyone who wants good accommodation and a welcoming host in Calgary",
      "Great stay and amazing host always response fast, very helpful and extremely flexible!",
      "Great value and great location!",
      "Our stay at this Airbnb in Calgary was fantastic! The host was incredibly welcoming and made sure everything was perfect for our arrival. The home was spotless, well-furnished, and had all the amenities we needed. The location was also great\u2014close to local attractions and in a quiet neighborhood. My wife and son had a comfortable and enjoyable experience throughout their stay. Highly recommend this place for anyone looking for a hassle-free and cozy stay in Calgary. Thank you Margarita",
      "we loved staying at Margaritas lovely condo. Located right in the heart of downtown this is a fantastic location just a few blocks from Lively 17 Ave. The building is very quiet and well maintained. The unit was spotless, kudos to the cleaning staff, it is apparent she uses professional cleaners on her team. The unit was spacious for our group of three and medium size dog. Everything was 5 stars, we had the perfect stray. Margarita goes above what most hosts do and is extremely welcoming, helpful and accommodating. Thanks for having us!",
      "Great apartment in an excellent quarter, especially with kids, to enjoy the city life. We got some difficulty in figuring out the access to the garage, but Margarita was very responsive to help us get in the apartment before she could come to give us an alternative key to the garage. She's also promptly replaced the broken microwave and provided a new kettle which made our life with kids much easier. The apartment has everything you need for a short or long stay in the city. Highly recommended!",
      "My friends and I LOVED this space. Margarita was so awesome and very accommodating when we had to push back our check in time! Also- the water pressure in shower was incredible and we loved the central location.",
      "Really nice spot, great location and the host was quick and helpful with any questions or concerns. <br/>Gym in building was pretty terrific as well. <br/>Lots of great places for coffee, food and drinks within a few steps. <br/>Would 100% stay again.",
      "Margarita\u2019s home was beautiful. Easily slept a group of 6, and had plenty of space. It was in a great location and walkable to 17th avenue and even to Stampede. I must also note that the shower pressure was amazing!!",
      "We stayed at Margarita\u2019s place for 13 days, the location was perfect. It was walking distance to groceries, banks, bus stop, c-train and everything you would need. It is also close to parks which made staying with a pet very convenient. The place was exactly as described and had everything we needed for a comfortable stay. It had complete amenities for cooking, had a work desk and fast internet. The place was immaculately clean when we arrived. The roof top lounge was a good area to wind down for the day. And most of all, Margarita was very friendly, easy to speak to and was very proactive in checking in on us. I really appreciate the stay and it made us feel welcome and comfortable in a new country. Thank you Margarita!",
      "We like the place! We truly enjoyed our stay. It has 2 rooms, the other room was really small for the other couple, and the other room is perfect for us though. But the overall place is awesome plus it\u2019s a pet friendly. Rooftop is a nice area to chill after a long day. It would also be perfect if they have a pool at the rooftop, my friends expected to have a pool cause they thought they have pool . Still it\u2019s worth of what we paid for. Plus the host is really responsive and accommodating. We recommend this place who would love to explore Calgary, it\u2019s close to so many nice spots within downtown.",
      "The best host in Calgary hands down!<br/>And the condo itself a true gem. I will definitely be booking her place and with her again and again and again!"

Host Margarita met me upon arrival, showed me around the building -- including the beautiful views from the rooftop -- and followed up the next day with cafe recommendations for remote working. Consummate host, who checked in a few times during my 16-day stay, which I extended an extra week due to loving the area. Pics are accurate, top floor means quieter, neighborhood has 2 grocery stores two blocks away, and 17th Ave is less than a five minute walk to restaurants and shops galore. I walked to downtown as well as to the Saddledome to catch a Flames preseason game. Super walkable and easy to get around. I also rented a car for a few days and it was nice to have access to the parking garage in the building. I really enjoyed my stay in Calgary, and Margarita and her apartment were part of the reason. I would stay there again and highly recommend!",

We had to go up the stairs and ask someone from our room to open the door of the stairs into the 'PH' level for us (as it was locked).

        "review": "Would recommend! I stayed for six nights, and was quite happy. Host was quick to respond and reached out to check in and make sure I was happy. Location was excellent, with 17th Ave a short distance away as well as a grocery store and drugstore if needed. Space was clean and well kept, and the shower pressure was excellent (a major point for me).<br/>Given the location and length of my stay, I was happy with the price point in comparison to other options in the same area.<br/>Only thing I will note is that if you are highly sensitive to sound from outside that it would be best to stay in the bedroom that does not have the AC unit. Earplugs would help with this, however. It was not enough of a concern for me, but worth mentioning. There was construction happening on the weekdays I was there, but given the location that is not unusual.",

Located right in the heart of downtown this is a fantastic location just a few blocks from Lively 17 Ave. The building is very quiet and well maintained. The unit was spotless, kudos to the cleaning staff, it is apparent she uses professional cleaners on her team. The unit was spacious for our group of three and medium size dog. Everything was 5 stars, we had the perfect stray. Margarita goes above what most hosts do and is extremely welcoming, helpful and accommodating. Thanks for having us!",

We got some difficulty in figuring out the access to the garage, but Margarita was very responsive to help us get in the apartment before she could come to give us an alternative key to the garage. She's also promptly replaced the broken microwave and provided a new kettle which made our life with kids much easier. The apartment has everything you need for a short or long stay in the city. Highly recommended!",

It is also close to parks which made staying with a pet very convenient. The place was exactly as described and had everything we needed for a comfortable stay. It had complete amenities for cooking, had a work desk and fast internet. The place was immaculately clean when we arrived. The roof top lounge was a good area to wind down for the day. And most of all, Margarita was very friendly, easy to speak to and was very proactive in checking in on us. I really appreciate the stay and it made us feel welcome and comfortable in a new country. Thank you Margarita!",

But the overall place is awesome plus it\u2019s a pet friendly. Rooftop is a nice area to chill after a long day. It would also be perfect if they have a pool at the rooftop, my friends expected to have a pool cause they thought they have pool . Still it\u2019s worth of what we paid for. Plus the host is really responsive and accommodating. We recommend this place who would love to explore Calgary, it\u2019s close to so many nice spots within downtown.",
