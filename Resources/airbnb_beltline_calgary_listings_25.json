      "Great stay at Taylor and Geoff’s place! Super walkable to restaurants in the Beltline. I opted for street parking in the evenings and had no issues. The value for location and amenities is hard to match! Would stay here again next time I need to be in the Beltline",
      "Geoff place was a great little stay. Downtown in Calgary near plenty of good restaurants it was easy to get around everywhere! Loved the little map at the front door to give local spots to stop by! Would happily stay there again in the future",
      "Geoff’s spot was a great place for my wife to stay at an affordable rate. It had a washer and dryer which was helpful and a kitchenette with an air fryer and fridge. The on-site parking was super helpful since parking can get expensive quickly. Overall, pretty good experience",
      "The perfect little place to bunker down after a long day of exploring.<br/>Everything was clean and tidy and the bed was super comfy!!<br/>There was a bit of noise from upstairs frequently but I guess that makes sense as it is the bottom floor!<br/>Very much enjoyed my stay here.",
      "We really enjoyed our stay here! Great location, super walkable, and convenient to all of our favorite places. Having the option for off-street parking was a huge plus for us. It’s a great space and we would definitely stay here again!",
      "Geoff's Airbnb was right in the heart of the city. We were able to leave the car parked up and walk everywhere in the city. The suite was clean and well furnished, with a lovely kitchen with all the amenities you need on a vacation. It was nice and private and clean. Geoff was a great host and always responded. He even gave us a contact number for emergencies at night, so very thoughtful. You may want to bring your earplugs if you want to sleep in. It was quiet at night, but we could hear the people above in the morning.",
      "Probably the best location to stay in Calgary!!! Within walking distance of downtown (lrt) and 17th .  We parked our vehicle and didn’t have to touch it all weekend.  Just remember it’s a basement suite so don’t expect fabulous views",
      "What a great find in the heart of downtown Calgary! Easily walkable to anything and everything in the downtown area. Great communication with the hosts who made sure I had everything I needed. Definitely recommend for a solo traveler or couple who wants to be close to all that downtown has to offer.",
      "A great experience overall. The suite was clean, comfortable, and had everything I needed. The location is super convenient, which made getting around really easy. Geoff and Taylor were incredibly responsive and helpful — communication was seamless throughout. I’d happily stay here again!",
      "Geoff’s place was clean and matched the description perfectly. Communication was easy and they were very responsive and accommodating to requests. The location is perfect for getting around downtown. Would definitely stay here again and have already booked again for another trip!",
      "Great stay! Close to all we needed, cozy and great communication from the hosts. It worked great for us!",
      "Convenient to plenty of restaurants and activities. We were grateful for washer/dryer. Host was very responsive and helpful.",
      "We appreciated the rate in which our hosts responded. They were quick to address concerns when we brought them to their attention. We had a concern with the bedding but they promptly changed it after we noticed a brown stain on the mattress pad and mattress, and they kindly offered to tackle other cleanliness issues we pointed out. However, we were disappointed with the overall cleanliness of the space upon arrival. There was noticeable buildup on the backsplash, dust caked in the bathroom fan aswell as on baseboards. While the hosts’ efforts to resolve these were appreciated, the initial condition of the property fell short of our expectations for a comfortable stay. If we weren’t pressed for time and alternative accommodations, we likely would not have stayed. We hope these issues can be addressed for future guests, as the hosts’ attentiveness shows their commitment to improving the experience.",
      "Always a wonderful stay at Geoff’s! He’s incredibly kind, quick to respond, and very flexible. I’ll always choose to stay here whenever it’s available.",
      "Had everything we needed for a weekend in Calgary. Location was great - near bars, restaurants and other cool sites. I highly recommend!",
      "The location of Geoff and Taylor's place was incredible and the fact that they offered parking was even more amazing!  The only downside is the lack of natural lighting and fresh air.  The blinds were closed for privacy (totally understandable),  but it would have been nice to be able to open up the window.  Luckily there was a really good fan, so it made for a comfortable night's sleep.  <br/>They were so great with communicating and checking in with me.  I let them know that the sink was draining slowly and that one of the plugs didn't seem to be working, assuring me they would look into it asap.  Any time I had a question they got back to me pretty much right away.<br/>Overall the good definitely outweighed the back and I can't wait to be back!",
      "Room was okay close to downtown and location where i wanted to go, hosts were responsive and helped out. Would definitely recommend",
      "Enjoyed the weekend in Calgary at Geoff and Taylor's place. <br/>Great location - we were there for an event at the MNP Center, which is about a 20 minute walk.<br/>Staying here, plus the cooperative weather, saved us on car rental and Uber fares. <br/>Safeway is a short walk away, as is 17th ave, with an amazing selection of restaurants!",
      "Great spot to stay close to the downtown area, bonus that it has a parking garage available. I wouldn't want to drive anything more than a large SUV though as getting in and out of the parking garage would be tricky...like a 10-point turn if you were driving a large truck lol. A little bit of noise from upstairs but I suppose you expect that in a townhome like this. But otherwise this was a nice no frills stay. Oh and a super comfy mattress!",
      "Wonderful area and exceptional accommodations. Had a perfect birthday! thanks so much Geoff.",
      "Check in was super easy, and the place was nice and clean! would go back!",
      "Lovely tree lined street, walking distance to restaurants and coffeehouses",
      "Geoff and his wife were so kind and it was the perfect stay! Comfy bed, clean, and walkable distance to a lot! They always responded right away! I would stay again :)",
      "Great location for walking to restaurants and around the downtown area. Train was close by to get to the zoo as well!"

The suite was clean and well furnished, with a lovely kitchen with all the amenities you need on a vacation. It was nice and private and clean. Geoff was a great host and always responded. He even gave us a contact number for emergencies at night, so very thoughtful. You may want to bring your earplugs if you want to sleep in. It was quiet at night, but we could hear the people above in the morning.",

        "review": "We appreciated the rate in which our hosts responded. They were quick to address concerns when we brought them to their attention. We had a concern with the bedding but they promptly changed it after we noticed a brown stain on the mattress pad and mattress, and they kindly offered to tackle other cleanliness issues we pointed out. However, we were disappointed with the overall cleanliness of the space upon arrival. There was noticeable buildup on the backsplash, dust caked in the bathroom fan aswell as on baseboards. While the hosts’ efforts to resolve these were appreciated, the initial condition of the property fell short of our expectations for a comfortable stay. If we weren’t pressed for time and alternative accommodations, we likely would not have stayed. We hope these issues can be addressed for future guests, as the hosts’ attentiveness shows their commitment to improving the experience.",
        "host_response": "Thank you for acknowledging our quick response and willingness to assist. However, your review overstates the issues.<br/>The home was professionally cleaned before check-in, and there is no cleaning fee to stay at our place - likely a large factor in your decision to book here. You noted a minor stain, which we immediately addressed, and we offered to reclean any areas of concern. Every request was handled promptly and respectfully.<br/>Citing dust on a bathroom ceiling fan—an out-of-reach fixture not typically inspected daily—as a sign of poor cleanliness is simply unreasonable. We welcome fair, constructive feedback, but we also stand by the quality and service that so many guests consistently recognize.<br/>We encourage future guests to approach stays with reasonable expectations and to review our many positive ratings for a more accurate picture of the experience."

The only downside is the lack of natural lighting and fresh air.  The blinds were closed for privacy (totally understandable),  but it would have been nice to be able to open up the window.  Luckily there was a really good fan, so it made for a comfortable night's sleep.  <br/>They were so great with communicating and checking in with me.  I let them know that the sink was draining slowly and that one of the plugs didn't seem to be working, assuring me they would look into it asap.  Any time I had a question they got back to me pretty much right away.<br/>Overall the good definitely outweighed the back and I can't wait to be back!",

      "Beautiful apartment with a great location but there is a lot of monitoring. We were told about the door cam watching for “extra guests” but there’s also sound detector inside the apartment and it felt like we were being watched. When we unplugged the modem to plug it directly into our laptop we were immediately messaged to plug it back in and it made us feel extremely uncomfortable.",
      "This was a fantastic stay! Our hosts, Richard and Teresa, were incredibly welcoming and made us feel right at home. The room was very comfortable and clean, with all the necessary amenities. A particular highlight was the stunning city view from the property. It was breathtaking both during the day and at night. Highly recommended!",
      "Richard & Teresa’s Airbnb was absolutely perfect for our trip. It is located in a prime location with many restaurants, coffee shops, bakeries and a food hall right across the street. We enjoyed being able to walk across the street and enjoy a meal or pickup a coffee. This unit has the most amazing view of the Calgary skyline that lit up at night. The unit was cozy, clean and set up very intentionally to ensure that guests have everything they need. They included multiple amenities from the in unit laundry to the complimentary snacks and drinks. We were very pleased with the space as well as the underground parking. We would definitely recommend this place to others and would definitely stay again :)",

      "Richard & Teresa’s place was clean, comfortable and very cozy. We got in late in which I really appreciate them understanding. We were welcomed with complimentary snacks which were very handy. It was nice to have coffee and creamer at the airbnb. There were also a few other things I noticed that would be handy if a person stayed longer; spices, cooking oil and vinaigrettes. The beds and pillows were so comfortable. We just all in all had a great stay. The view and the lights at night are absolutely beautiful!",

The views were amazing, making my time there truly enjoyable. I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a great stay in Calgary!",

The views, in the evening, from the Airbnb are gorgeous.  The bed is super comfy with lots of pillow options.  The couch is cozy to tuck in and relax.  Overall, 10/10 and will definitely be booking again",

Great food and entertainment right outside your door and you can’t beat the skyline view and sunrise from this corner apartment. <br/>The couch and beds were comfortable, stocked with most things you’d need during a visit. The hosts were very responsive and accommodating. <br/>Absolutely recommend staying here.",

      "Richard and Teresa are exactly what Air BnB hosts should be -- responsive, professional, kind, and go the extra mile to provide lovely touches such as welcome snacks, coffee and tea stocks, and kitchen basics like oil and spices. <br/>We were so fortunate to find this AirBnB, and we would book again unreservedly. Richard and Teresa were extremely kind hosts, and very generous with our Christmas Day checkout. <br/>The unit itself is exactly like the photos and as described. The views are absolutely amazing, and it is both relaxing and awe-inspiring to just sit and look at the city lights in the evening. The decor is top notch, and well thought out. Homey touches such as curated DVDs, games, and books make this a true city retreat. <br/>Having underground parking and an elevator made it accessible to people with more limited mobility, and was super important to us. <br/>This was the perfect location for our last minute visit, and we felt so kindly accommodated by Richard and Teresa.  Thank you again",

We were told about the door cam watching for “extra guests” but there’s also sound detector inside the apartment and it felt like we were being watched. When we unplugged the modem to plug it directly into our laptop we were immediately messaged to plug it back in and it made us feel extremely uncomfortable.",
        "host_response": "We’re glad you appreciated the apartment and location. We’re disappointed, however, by the misrepresentation of your experience.<br/>All security devices — a doorbell camera at the entrance and a sound-level monitor inside — are clearly disclosed in our listing and house rules. These are standard and only monitor what’s allowed by Airbnb to ensure safety, prevent parties, and protect our neighbours’ peace.<br/>You did not unplug the internet modem (which remains in plain view by the TV), but rather a concealed smart lock/camera hub inside an electrical panel at the back of a closet, which disabled our entry security — a serious rules violation. This, along with repeated noise disturbances and disrespectful conduct caught on camera after reminders, is why we reached out during your stay.<br/>We take guest comfort seriously, but also have a duty to maintain a safe and respectful environment for everyone."

It is located in a prime location with many restaurants, coffee shops, bakeries and a food hall right across the street. We enjoyed being able to walk across the street and enjoy a meal or pickup a coffee. This unit has the most amazing view of the Calgary skyline that lit up at night. The unit was cozy, clean and set up very intentionally to ensure that guests have everything they need. They included multiple amenities from the in unit laundry to the complimentary snacks and drinks. We were very pleased with the space as well as the underground parking. We would definitely recommend this place to others and would definitely stay again :)",

Richard and Teresa were extremely kind hosts, and very generous with our Christmas Day checkout. <br/>The unit itself is exactly like the photos and as described. The views are absolutely amazing, and it is both relaxing and awe-inspiring to just sit and look at the city lights in the evening. The decor is top notch, and well thought out. Homey touches such as curated DVDs, games, and books make this a true city retreat. <br/>Having underground parking and an elevator made it accessible to people with more limited mobility, and was super important to us. <br/>This was the perfect location for our last minute visit, and we felt so kindly accommodated by Richard and Teresa.

The unit itself was great,  well equipped and comfortable. (Sofa needs changing). <br/>Con’s<br/>Since this is a property managed Airbnb, the only minor issue was, having a single point of contact as a host. “Call host” typically directed you to an answering service and ultimately to the host - a new experience for me staying Airbnb’s.",
      "Excellent and beautifully located unit. We enjoyed our stay a lot! I recommend this place, close to the river and close to grocery shops, pharmacies, restaurants, etc!",
      "Loved the stay. Great to be around the heart of mission with the river and the restaurants it offered",
      "I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at Aaron's place. The place is clean, great furniture, nice rooms, great kitchen, and an excellent place to sit and work with a nice desk setup.  I also walked into the city regularly, to work at coffee shops. The walk is only ~15-20 minutes, which is also pleasant to get fresh air and see the city. The local area of Mission is also enjoyable if you want some food or a smaller coffee shop.<br/>The building and property are also beautiful, but the apartment I stayed in (202) is on the non-river side. I think the listing photo is a little misleading, as it showcases the river photo first, but this is not your experience in this apartment. Your keys get you access to this back area with the river, but only the grass and some used dirty lawn furniture. If you are renting this apartment for that beautiful view and outdoor experience, you are not going to get it.<br/>Still worth the stay, if you want a beautiful apartment and a well-organised AirBnB experience!",
      "Small, cozy space. Convenient and great location!",
      "This place was great! Theres a lot of great restaurants nearby and its in a quiet neighborhood. Would definitely stay again. Only issue I came across was the parking. I could not access the garage and unfortunately the issue was not resolved during my stay. It made things a bit inconvenient as I had to find street parking and then walk to the apartment. But again other than that it was nice :)",
      "This place was great for our few days in Calgary at the stampede. It was walking distance max 15min walk to the stampede and very close to excellent breakfast joints and other restaurants. The place was spacious for a one bedroom and we had an additional person sleep on the couch (not a pull out). Aaron was very responsive and quick to respond when a few items (extra towel and linens) were missing from the place. We would recommend to others!",
      "My partner and I visited Calgary for a short few days, and we had a great stay at Aaron's apartment. It is a great apartment with everything we need. The location is great, easy to walk to public transit. And there are lots of good restaurants blocks away. Aaron gives clear instructions, and the communication we had was friendly and straightforward.",
      "This is a great place to stay! Super central in the best neighbourhood with restaurants, bars, and shops in walking distance. Right next to river, which was an amazing place to walk in the heat wave. The place was clean and stylish. Bed was comfortable. Would absolutely stay again next time in Calgary!",
      "Aaron’s place was great. It had everything you needed in the kitchen, laundry and bathroom (along with travel skin care samples). The condo also had a nice back yard with lawn chairs right by the Elbow river. It was a great place to hang out with our Golden.  Thanks Aaron!",
      "We loved our stay at Aaron's place and will definitely be back! Aaron was a great, responsive host and his thorough instructions were both super helpful and appreciated. Aaron's place is in a beautiful area - we felt super safe and right at home. The apartment was super clean and comfortable. Super close to restaurants and there's the river right out back and a nice park right down the road. We really enjoyed the centrality of Aaron's place - everywhere we visited was a short drive away. Overall, great place and great host!",

I also walked into the city regularly, to work at coffee shops. The walk is only ~15-20 minutes, which is also pleasant to get fresh air and see the city. The local area of Mission is also enjoyable if you want some food or a smaller coffee shop.<br/>The building and property are also beautiful, but the apartment I stayed in (202) is on the non-river side. I think the listing photo is a little misleading, as it showcases the river photo first, but this is not your experience in this apartment. Your keys get you access to this back area with the river, but only the grass and some used dirty lawn furniture. If you are renting this apartment for that beautiful view and outdoor experience, you are not going to get it.<br/>Still worth the stay, if you want a beautiful apartment and a well-organised AirBnB experience!",

Super close to restaurants and there's the river right out back and a nice park right down the road. We really enjoyed the centrality of Aaron's place - everywhere we visited was a short drive away. Overall, great place and great host!",

      "Had a great stay at Clint and Diana’s place for a girls weekend. It was the perfect size for four girls and very close to many bars in the city. Having a parking spot for this area of the city is also a great benefit. Clint and Diana were also very responsive as hosts. Would definitely recommend/stay here again.",
      "So, Clint and Diana were very nice and super responsive, the place was clean and nothing was broken. <br/>However, there wasn’t enough toilet paper or paper towels, No BBQ utensils, and only one key to get in and out of the building.<br/>Lastly the pool was completely misleading. <br/>Super small, and didn’t get really any sun.",
      "Very clear videos on how check In and anything you may need help with during your stay. The apartment was beautiful and very comfortable. Quality furniture and linens. The building itself felt secure and safe. The pool was great for the kids to swim. Overall very happy with our stay, only downside was that the parking space is VERY tight for any larger vehicles .. we have a Toyota sienna van and ended up paying for parking at the Impark parking lot just across the street (no biggie it was very close) but just a heads up to anyone with a larger vehicle it might not fit.",
      "Perfect stay complete with stunning views, ultra luxurious decor, quiet and secure building, access to a heated pool and fitness room, full kitchen and laundry, and walkable to all downtown attractions and activities! From the moment we booked, Clint and Diana were warm and welcoming, quick to respond, flexible, and ensured we had everything we need. We can’t wait to come back and stay here again! ❤️",
      "If all AirBnBs were this clean, cozy and easy to navigate as a rental there would be no place for hotels ever again. Great hosts, that were quick to respond and offered suggestions regarding local amenities, as I wasn’t familiar with the city. Beautiful space! Bedding is a huge deal for me and everything was top notch quality and comfort. I couldn’t be happier.",
      "Clint and Diana’s place is perfect for a stay in downtown Calgary. They are both really great to work with, they made check in seamless and had some really helpful videos to walk you through the process. Their apartment is gorgeous and well appointed with everything one would need for an evening dining in. I highly recommend their place for a stay In Calgary",
      "Clint and Diana were very helpful, the check-in instructions even involved videos which I appreciated. The condo is bright and cheerful with beautiful views of Calgary and the mountains in the distance. We didn’t have any trouble getting to where we needed to go, it’s really central. <br/>The kitchen is well equipped, the couch is per for looking out at the city with a beverage and the balcony is a really nice place to relax. The beds are comfortable, the sheets are soft and the pillows were not too hard or too soft. <br/>All around a very enjoyable visit.",
      "This downtown location is hard to beat and being on the 17th floor you get views of the mountains in the distance from the balcony. it was so nice to have a balcony with a bbq to use in the evening for cooking super as well as the two chairs provided on the balcony as well.",
      "Great location, walkable, close to public transport, market and good restaurants. Recommended for travelers who like to explore…Great views to the west, secure building with amenities listed; would return on another visit to Calgary!",
      "We had a great stay  and would have been happy to  stay longer. Clean bright stylish accommodation with all the facilities we could need. Good city views.   Communication was great and all the instructions were very clear. Good location and plenty of eating places nearby plus a good size supermarket Parking space included and was a good size. If you need parking for a large truck there areseveral parking lots nearby. We would have no hesitation at staying again.",
      "Great cozy little condo that is well maintained and super functional.  Comfy beds and well stocked. Super building security. Walkable to 17th and downtown. Clint was very responsive and accommodating!  Didn’t have chance to try pool but it looked good.  Would definitely stay again.",
      "The condo was the perfect location for everything we needed downtown. It was well taken care of, clean, and relaxing. Check in and out process was very clear and easy. We would stay again.",
      "When we arrived at this Airbnb it smelled strongly of cigarette smoke. I contacted the hosts and while they said they could not smell any cigarette smoke, they were very responsive bringing us an air purifier. While I did appreciate they tried to remedy the situation and left some chocolates the place still smelled smokey for our stay.<br/>The apartment was clean, had great views, coffee and a well stocked kitchen  but it was very tight for three women. The sofa bed was very hard, and there were no sheets for it. There were some pillows in the closet but there were no pillowcases. So instead of each of us being able to have her own sleeping space we had to double up and share a bed which was not preferable. <br/>The listing stated there is body soap and a bidet but there was not. I think this place has potential but it needs to be accurately listed and guests should set their expectations for a small place that would be good for two adults and maybe some small children.",
      "We enjoyed our stay.  Super quiet and comfortable.  Great location.",
      "It was a great location for downtown Calgary. Also, the bed was sooooo comfy!",

To clarify, guests are provided with two access devices, as the parkade remote also works for building entry in addition to the fob, apologies if that wasn’t clear. We’ll also ensure BBQ utensils, paper towels, and toilet paper are fully replenished, as we pride ourselves on keeping the unit well stocked. The pool size and layout are shown in our photos, though we understand it may have felt different in person. We’re not sure the times you were at the pool; however, the deck typically enjoys sun until mid- afternoon. We always want our guests to feel comfortable & at home, and we’re happy to keep making each stay even better than the last. Take good care and we welcome you back anytime."

        "host_response": "Thank you so much for your kind note! We’re so glad you found the check-in easy, the unit comfortable. The pool fun is always a hit with the kids. We appreciate your note about the parking space - vans & larger vehicles can be a tighter fit, and your tip will be helpful for future guests. We’re happy the nearby lot worked out conveniently.  We’d love to welcome you back anytime!"

I contacted the hosts and while they said they could not smell any cigarette smoke, they were very responsive bringing us an air purifier. While I did appreciate they tried to remedy the situation and left some chocolates the place still smelled smokey for our stay.<br/>The apartment was clean, had great views, coffee and a well stocked kitchen  but it was very tight for three women. The sofa bed was very hard, and there were no sheets for it. There were some pillows in the closet but there were no pillowcases. So instead of each of us being able to have her own sleeping space we had to double up and share a bed which was not preferable. <br/>The listing stated there is body soap and a bidet but there was not. I think this place has potential but it needs to be accurately listed and guests should set their expectations for a small place that would be good for two adults and maybe some small children.",
        "host_response": "Thank you for your feedback. We’re glad you enjoyed the views, coffee and appreciated our efforts with the air purifier & treats. While we didn’t notice any cigarette smoke ourselves - even after checkout - we trust your experience and hope the purifier helped ensure clean air for your stay. Bedding (duvet, sheets, & pillow with pillowcase) for the sofa bed can be found inside the sofa storage itself. Since bedding is such an important detail we’ll be sure to highlight this for future guests; however, we wish you had reached out - just as you did about the smoke - as it would have been a quick and simple fix to let you know where to find it. The square footage & floor plan are included in our listing so guests can ensure the space fits their needs, and we’ve corrected an oversight in the amenities list (bidet) to keep everything accurate moving forward. All the best with your future travels."

      "Our stay at Bryn's place was absolutely perfect! The location is very central but on a quiet street right off the main road, with everything you would need in walking distance. The apartment was very clean & cozy with beautiful decor in every room! The kitchen was stocked with necessities and we enjoyed using the projector to watch movies. I would definitely stay here again or recommend this bnb to anyone visiting Calgary :)",
      "I just want to say this is probably one of my favorites Airbnb ever. The location is perfect, Bryn was super friendly and the place is amazing. Everything was great so for sure I would recommend it.",
      "This was a lovely Airbnb with lots of character and was a peaceful and relaxing spot after being out in the Rockies hiking all day. We really enjoyed the tea bar and exploring all the beautiful antiques in the home. There's no elevator and the unit is up 3 flights of stairs. It was really quiet and peaceful inside and when you'd walk out to the main street, you were part of all the action and in a great area buzzing with people, music, restaurants, and a great vibe. We recommend this Airbnb and would love to stay here again on our next visit!",
      "This was a perfect space to stay and enjoy Stampede and explore the Beltline! The space was cute and clean, and the cooling unit in the bedroom kept it cool enough even in peak summer months. Bryn was very communicative and made checkin and checkout easy. I'd definitely come back!",
      "OMG! What a great stay! I got an honor to stay at Bryn’s suite for five days and would love to spend more time but vacation days are running out. Apartment itself is a mix of Art Nouveau art gallery and highly functional apartment. Nice laundry room in the basement of building with high quality washer and dryer. Bryn is extremely attentive host and was instantly communicated to lend us a helpful hand. Location could not be any better. Right on 17th Ave but set a little back so it’s very tranquil. On one side we had shops and restaurants in walking distance and on the other side we had upscale neighborhood with walking paths to have an evening stroll. I couldn’t make any better choice for my stay in Calgary. Definitely will stay again.",
      "Loved staying here! The place felt super cozy, and the movie setup was perfect for a chill night in. The bed was really comfy, and the kitchen had everything I needed. The location is awesome — I walked to tons of great restaurants and grabbed coffee at Analog just a minute away. Definitely a great spot for a fun and easy stay in Calgary!",
      "The Rosewood Suite was our perfect oasis during a whirlwind weekend in Calgary. Situated just off 17th street it gave us access to breakfast at our doorstep, lunch one block away, and late night snack spots and bars scoutable from our window.<br/>Being just at the edge of downtown meant we were walking distance from all the best Museums, attractions and events (like Stampeded, Yeehaw!). But when we were done for the night, the suite felt tucked away just far enough from the bustle, so we could relax and enjoy the beautiful decor, creative amenities, and the star of the suite the king sized bed!!<br/>All in all, this was a 11/10 experience. The location was perfect, the suite was idyllic and the our host was friendly and helpful. Absolutely my best experience in an Airbnb. Can't wait to visit again!",
      "Ten out of ten affordable apartment.  Artsy-art deco feel to it.  One minute walk to 17th ave shops and restaurants but super quiet. Everything you need in the kitchen. Definitely recommended.",
      "We booked this Air B&B on a whim to have a date night. The location was great which was the first reason we booked. However, the easy check in, amazing decor, cleanliness and welcoming setting will keep us coming back. A stone's throw to the many pubs, restaurants shops and amenities is amazing, however being half a block off the main strip allowed for a restful sleep. Parking included is also a plus as it is paid or permit parking only in the area. This is a great place to book with great ambience and convenient location. Will highly recommend to anyone traveling to Calgary.",
      "My stay at Bryn's was perfect! I loved looking at all her art, appreciated the special touches she put in and definately enjoyed the location. I also loved that the space was squeaky clean! <br/>Totally appreciate this space and will book again if I am called to the annual whoop up of the Stampede!",
      "What a lovely air bnb!  The Rosewood Suite has a classic decor.  No detail is too small from the art wall covered in paintings to the furniture to the light fixtures and door knobs!  You can even look up to a constellation of stars in the bedroom.  It was such a relaxing and charming atmosphere.  The central location made it easy to get to anywhere in Calgary I wanted to go to.  And it was great to be able to walk to charming restaurants along 17th Ave  for breakfast and dinner.  I felt like I had truly gotten away for the weekend to someplace in Europe.   And the king size bed was so comfortable!  I often have a sore back when I sleep away from home but my back felt great and I had a terrific sleep both nights.",
      "Bryn's apartment was great! The kitchen and the whole apartment are very tastefully decorated. We felt very comfortable, like at home. There are basic amenities in the kitchen, such as spices and oil, so you can prepare food right away. There are many lovely details and 17th Street is around the corner. We really liked it. Thank you!!",
      "One of the most uniquely decorated air b n bs I’ve stayed in. Bed was super comfortable. Excellent location. Would definitely stay again.",
      "Fantastic stay – quiet, cozy, and great location.<br/>We had a great stay at this Airbnb, the unit is on the top floor of a six-unit building, and it was incredibly quiet—you can’t hear neighbors or street noise, which is rare for such a prime location.  Having a coffee shop and Shoppers Drug Mart right outside was super convenient for quick groceries and  coffee in the AM.<br/>The space itself was cozy and comfortable, especially in the living room  looking out the window—beautiful brick architecture, blue skies, and Calgary’s downtown skyline in the background. Also it was very cold outside so we stayed in most nights and tried out the home movie theater experience, it was very neat.  I’d like to return in the summer to take full advantage of the walkability and everything 17th Ave has to offer. Highly recommend!",
      "This is the most beautiful, luxurious airbnb I have ever stayed in. My only complaint is that I couldn’t stay forever.",
      "We were lucky enough to spend a night at Bryn's place, and everything was perfect! The video projector screen, the bathtub, the decoration, the location in the city: we liked everything! <br/>The little extra? The memory foam bed, amazing! <br/>Bryn was also very responsive and full of good advice! <br/>In short, I highly recommend it!"

We really enjoyed the tea bar and exploring all the beautiful antiques in the home. There's no elevator and the unit is up 3 flights of stairs. It was really quiet and peaceful inside and when you'd walk out to the main street, you were part of all the action and in a great area buzzing with people, music, restaurants, and a great vibe. We recommend this Airbnb and would love to stay here again on our next visit!",

Apartment itself is a mix of Art Nouveau art gallery and highly functional apartment. Nice laundry room in the basement of building with high quality washer and dryer. Bryn is extremely attentive host and was instantly communicated to lend us a helpful hand. Location could not be any better. Right on 17th Ave but set a little back so it’s very tranquil. On one side we had shops and restaurants in walking distance and on the other side we had upscale neighborhood with walking paths to have an evening stroll. I couldn’t make any better choice for my stay in Calgary. Definitely will stay again.",

Situated just off 17th street it gave us access to breakfast at our doorstep, lunch one block away, and late night snack spots and bars scoutable from our window.<br/>Being just at the edge of downtown meant we were walking distance from all the best Museums, attractions and events (like Stampeded, Yeehaw!). But when we were done for the night, the suite felt tucked away just far enough from the bustle, so we could relax and enjoy the beautiful decor, creative amenities, and the star of the suite the king sized bed!!<br/>All in all, this was a 11/10 experience. The location was perfect, the suite was idyllic and the our host was friendly and helpful. Absolutely my best experience in an Airbnb. Can't wait to visit again!",

However, the easy check in, amazing decor, cleanliness and welcoming setting will keep us coming back. A stone's throw to the many pubs, restaurants shops and amenities is amazing, however being half a block off the main strip allowed for a restful sleep. Parking included is also a plus as it is paid or permit parking only in the area. This is a great place to book with great ambience and convenient location. Will highly recommend to anyone traveling to Calgary.",

No detail is too small from the art wall covered in paintings to the furniture to the light fixtures and door knobs!  You can even look up to a constellation of stars in the bedroom.  It was such a relaxing and charming atmosphere.  The central location made it easy to get to anywhere in Calgary I wanted to go to.  And it was great to be able to walk to charming restaurants along 17th Ave  for breakfast and dinner.  I felt like I had truly gotten away for the weekend to someplace in Europe.   And the king size bed was so comfortable!  I often have a sore back when I sleep away from home but my back felt great and I had a terrific sleep both nights.",

Having a coffee shop and Shoppers Drug Mart right outside was super convenient for quick groceries and  coffee in the AM.<br/>The space itself was cozy and comfortable, especially in the living room  looking out the window—beautiful brick architecture, blue skies, and Calgary’s downtown skyline in the background. Also it was very cold outside so we stayed in most nights and tried out the home movie theater experience, it was very neat.  I’d like to return in the summer to take full advantage of the walkability and everything 17th Ave has to offer. Highly recommend!",

The room was cozy and felt very comfortable for my husband and me.<br/>ONE TIP: <br/>The condo is located on the 21st floor, so be prepared to wait for the elevator. If you are not renting a car, consider calling your Uber once you arrive in the lobby.  Uber drivers are readily available around the building and typically arrive in under 3 minutes.  Thank you, Franny, for a wonderful stay!",

If you are not renting a car, consider calling your Uber once you arrive in the lobby.  Uber drivers are readily available around the building and typically arrive in under 3 minutes.

      "Easy and seamless stay, JD was very proactive with reaching out and asking if I needed anything. Responded immediately. Place was in a great location and the apartment was clean and tidy with everything I needed. Thank you for your stay.",
      "We had a great time at JD Lee’s place! He made it possible for us to stay there on very short notice, and the communication couldn’t have been better. The location is central and close to several bars and restaurants. We’d definitely recommend it!",
      "Interior was clean and well stocked. Way too hot in the unit even though it was cool outside the entire time so I left sliding door open at night which allowed smells and noise.  Air conditioner did not cool off the unit even when running all night, whether or not door was left open. Sliding door did not have a lock anyway. I asked how to cool off the unit, with cryptic response. I gave up and left after 4 days of sweat. Too smelly and hot. Also scary building for a single woman. Above liquor store, homeless people, marijuana,",
      "Great location, and very good communication. JD reacted quickly and tried his best to solve any problem as fast as possible. Unfortunately, we cannot give 5 stars as there were too many things that would have needed long-term maintenance beforehand. We were constantly confronted with new problems . The first night, we could not find any bedding, and there was only 1 towel.  They were all well hidden in the couch, but we could not find where and how to open it. The main light in the living room was broken. The mosquito net had a huge hole.  The bathroom sink was clogged up, and JD had to come twice to resolve the problem. The shower hose was full of holes; JD bought a new one and put it in the same day. Last not least, the oven did not heat up beyond 270 F which jeopardized our cooking plans.<br/>As JD was very responsive, we trust that he resolves all the issues soon. If we had not been busy for 3 days with repair requests, we might have given 5 stars; maybe next time.",
      "The unit was well kept, clean and had a minimalist feel to it. The location is excellent because it close to many restaurants and shopping. It is a busy street with many bars and pubs in the area but the unit is in the back of the building and there is no excessive noise. Overall a great stay! Thanks JD!",
      "This location was perfect. Within walking distance to many great restaurants/bars, shopping and arenas. JD was an excellent host. He was extremely responsive to any issue we had and provided excellent recommendations for things to do in the area. The only thing we didn’t love was the bed was a little uncomfortable. Otherwise, highly recommend this spot.",
      "Spot was very nice and quiet. Walking distance to lots of fun places.",
      "I booked JD's place for my parents during Stampede. This upped the price, but compared to similar properties JD's was more fairly priced. JD was a great host and very communicative. His instructions were clear and in depth and check in went very smoothly. JD even communicated that the apartment may be noisier than usual being on 17th during Stampede. However, my parents reported that noise from the street was not an issue as they were facing the back. JD was also readily available via message during the stay should we need him. <br/>The apartment was spotless when we arrived and had all amenities needed for a comfortable stay. It was well presented and had plenty of space for two. My parents reported that the bed was comfy and easy to sleep in. Their only complaint was that the air conditioning unit was too loud to use at night (another thing JD did pre-warn us about). <br/>The apartment is in a great location being on 17th and I would definitely recommend it! Thank you JD",
      "During our stay, JD was very accommodating in addressing each issue that we had, despite the occasional slow responses. The area was perfect—with the restaurants, shops, and grocery stores within walking distance. The Airbnb itself was great, and it provided a lot of essential items (including lint rollers which we appreciated). I wouldn’t really recommend staying here if you’re sensitive to the heat, which I was. The lack of ventilation should be of note, as open windows were required the entire time we were there just to keep the temperature tolerable. Though, leaving the windows open also meant being able to hear all the commotion outside the building since it’s a pretty busy street, especially at night. Aside from those things, the place was nice, clean, and simple.",
      "We loved our stay at JDs place. It was in the perfect location where we were able to walk to everything we needed. It was a clean, minimalist space and had everything we could have needed. We will definitely rebook if we ever come back to Calgary.",
      "100% would recommend this place to anyone! Great spot—lots of local restaurants and bars nearby, apartment is very clean and bright, and the parking spot was in a great place!",
      "We really enjoyed JD's place, our first time in Calgary, central, can walk to almost everything, and it had a parking space so we could park our car that we traveled to Banff with. Thank you!",
      "I had a great stay at JD's place. It was very clean, all the furniture was like new and comfortable. Giant TV with many viewing options. The bathroom was spotless and the shower was great. I have already rebooked there for my next visit to Calgary!",

Unfortunately, we cannot give 5 stars as there were too many things that would have needed long-term maintenance beforehand. We were constantly confronted with new problems . The first night, we could not find any bedding, and there was only 1 towel.  They were all well hidden in the couch, but we could not find where and how to open it. The main light in the living room was broken. The mosquito net had a huge hole.  The bathroom sink was clogged up, and JD had to come twice to resolve the problem. The shower hose was full of holes; JD bought a new one and put it in the same day. Last not least, the oven did not heat up beyond 270 F which jeopardized our cooking plans.<br/>As JD was very responsive, we trust that he resolves all the issues soon. If we had not been busy for 3 days with repair requests, we might have given 5 stars; maybe next time.",

Please refrain yourself from saying “there was no bedding” when the main bed was completely ready. That’s not true. <br/>You were asking for extra beddings/towels; which were provided immediately. <br/>I advised you to take a look underneath the pull out couch in the living room, and you were not able to find em yourself. I popped by the property to show you where in person. <br/>I did offer early check in and late check out as a nice gesture at no cost, which seems you do not appreciate."

JD was a great host and very communicative. His instructions were clear and in depth and check in went very smoothly. JD even communicated that the apartment may be noisier than usual being on 17th during Stampede. However, my parents reported that noise from the street was not an issue as they were facing the back. JD was also readily available via message during the stay should we need him. <br/>The apartment was spotless when we arrived and had all amenities needed for a comfortable stay. It was well presented and had plenty of space for two. My parents reported that the bed was comfy and easy to sleep in. Their only complaint was that the air conditioning unit was too loud to use at night (another thing JD did pre-warn us about). <br/>The apartment is in a great location being on 17th and I would definitely recommend it! Thank you JD",

        "review": "During our stay, JD was very accommodating in addressing each issue that we had, despite the occasional slow responses. The area was perfect—with the restaurants, shops, and grocery stores within walking distance. The Airbnb itself was great, and it provided a lot of essential items (including lint rollers which we appreciated). I wouldn’t really recommend staying here if you’re sensitive to the heat, which I was. The lack of ventilation should be of note, as open windows were required the entire time we were there just to keep the temperature tolerable. Though, leaving the windows open also meant being able to hear all the commotion outside the building since it’s a pretty busy street, especially at night. Aside from those things, the place was nice, clean, and simple.",

      "Great communication when checking in, we arrived a few minutes early and had to reset the front door lock to get a new code to get in, thankfully very responsive host was helpful. Place was clean, tidy and comfortable. Parking around the area was mostly hassle free.",
      "Beautiful Airbnb. Very comfortable stay! Very well equipped! Beautiful surroundings and everywhere is within walking distance. <br/>I would recommend to anyone to rent here.",
      "My husband and I, along with my in-laws, stayed at Mike and Heather’s place for a few days. Their place was well equipped, and though there was four of us, we were able to still be comfortable with a bit of a smaller space. The views at night were a great bonus and very walkable to many restaurants and touristy spots in Calgary. Mike and Heather were also responsive to many of our questions about the place. They were great hosts! <br/>Highly recommend for any solo travellers or couples who are looking for a place to stay right in the heart of Calgary.",
      "I really enjoyed my stay here, it’s a nice, cozy and super clean apartment, looks just like in the pictures, and you are literally in downtown and around so much to do and beautiful attractions. I will be having to come back to Calgary and I will definitely be trying to hop on this place again because, top notch! Not to mention, if you have a question you’re not sure about or with, you simply just ask Heather and literally, seconds you’ll get a response. And instructions giving are super simple to follow and understand, very proactive thinking! 10/10 would recommend and cannot recommend enough!",

Bed was really comfortable too! We didn't use them but I liked that they had some board games and books for downtime, too.<br/>We didn't notice any noise from neighbours which was great, and the street noise was surprisingly quiet being so centrally located. <br/>The building was very conveniently located especially for our needs, and we would absolutely recommend or stay again!",

      "It was a great stay, generally the house was clean. Except that the room we stayed in had a lot of dust on the floor. But that's a small thing. The host is really great, although we didn't see him in person, we communicated friendly online.",

Lots of restaurants and bars within walking distance,and easy access to some great running paths.<br/>Would definitely stay with Tareq again!",
      "A great trip, you can see that the owner has made careful preparations, and everything is perfect from the details to the calendar on the bookshelf and the paper in the bathroom. The downtown is very close, and it can be reached by bus and on foot. I like that I will stay here next time I go to Calgary, and I will recommend it to my friends!",
      "A great stay! Tareq was super helpful, communicative, and thoughtful. Even when we were coming down the mountains and didn't have reception to provide timely updates on our arrival, Tareq was patient and worked with us. I appreciated my conversations with Tareq and admire his love for travel. The space was extremely clean which we were grateful for, especially coming back to the city after camping. Would stay again!",
      "The room was absolutely perfect! Very clean and cozy. Tareq is incredibly kind and helpful, and I’m truly grateful for his warm hospitality.

Instructions and communications are so detailed and helpful, Tareq always keeps you updated and even tracks flights when needed.<br/>Room is clean, beautiful and comfortable.

      "I visited tareq’s place for a day for my US VISA APPOINTMENT at Calgary embassy. The place was exactly the same as it was described in listing. The us embassy is just minutes away by cab . Tareq has shown all his creations in the living room and bed room by the decor he has done. You will find everything you need at his house. Amenities were also same as he had described. He is very friendly and showed me everything while coming home. Check out is also very easy!  If you are looking for Indian cuisine then it’s available nearby the place at walking distance.",

      "Had a great stay at Tareq's place. Walkable and very close to downtown, great restaurants just a block away. Tareq is friendly and helpful and lovely to chat with!",
      "We absolutely loved our stay, and while I initially didn’t realize this was a shared apartment (my oversight—I should have read the description more carefully), it turned out to be a wonderful experience thanks to an incredible host, Tareq . He was warm, respectful, and went out of his way to make us feel comfortable, yet he was also very private—spending time in his room or at work—so we never felt crowded and had all the space we needed.<br/>Tareq’s communication was excellent; he offered thoughtful local recommendations and was always prompt and helpful in his responses. He’s a wonderful person, and we felt completely at ease during our stay. We also really appreciated being able to use his washer and dryer before continuing our travels—such a helpful and generous perk!<br/>The location is fantastic—within walking distance of restaurants, cafes, and the Stampede grounds, making it ideal for the event. <br/>Thank you, Tareq, for your hospitality and kindness!",
      "Hi Tareq,<br/>Thank you very much for your warm hospitality. Your place was very convenient for me to attend the programs in BMO and GMC.",
      "Tareq has been really helpful and flexible with check in times, the place was immaculate and everything was neat and tidy. Would definitely stay there again!"

Due to the earlier check-in offered, the room had to be cleaned and prepared the night before, and since we are experiencing a heatwave currently, I left the room window open. Living in downtown means I have to deal with dust on a daily basis, however, I take the cleanness of the apartment very seriously. I appreciate your concern, and will do better."

He was warm, respectful, and went out of his way to make us feel comfortable, yet he was also very private—spending time in his room or at work—so we never felt crowded and had all the space we needed.<br/>Tareq’s communication was excellent; he offered thoughtful local recommendations and was always prompt and helpful in his responses. He’s a wonderful person, and we felt completely at ease during our stay. We also really appreciated being able to use his washer and dryer before continuing our travels—such a helpful and generous perk!<br/>The location is fantastic—within walking distance of restaurants, cafes, and the Stampede grounds, making it ideal for the event. <br/>Thank you, Tareq, for your hospitality and kindness!",

      "Beth was an amazing host! She was very responsive and provided very clear instructions for whenever we needed help. Her place offered stunning views of the Calgary Tower especially at night when the whole city is lit up! The place was very clean and comes with complete amenities that made our stay feel like at home. Definitely staying here again in the future!",
      "I was suppose to stay here for 3 nights, ended up staying for two nights because I couldn’t check in early. The host insisted I wait till 4pm before checking in and I had to go lodge in a hotel till next day. Secondly, the host would have informed me to use the buzzer to come in first day (this could be improved). Location is fantastic, near downtown with easy access to everything. I don’t know if I’d stay again.",
      "I really enjoyed my stay  - I was here for a conference and found the location easy, walkable and convenient. There were some homeless around but - as a single woman - I didn’t not feel uneasy at all.  There is also a security / concierge on the door. The host was fantastic, very responsive and proactive. No issues with check in, all very easy…. The view is fantastic, you get the sunrise which is nice. It’s a cute small apartment, the washing machine and dryer were great as well. I would stay again for sure!",
      "We had an amazing stay at Beth's airbnb! The place was clean and cozy and the location was convenient. Beth was accommodating and made sure everything went smoothly! would definitely stay here again!",
      "We enjoyed our stay with Beth. She had clear instructions on how to check in and was responsive if we had questions. The best part of the bnb was the view and the furnished patio. Would stay here again! :)",
      "Came to Calgary for a conference and chose to stay here instead of a hotel. It was wonderful decision. Apartment was exactly as described. View was wonderful. The balcony was a huge plus. Would recommend to anyone coming to Calgary for vacation or work.",
      "Wow 🤩 5/5 !! We enjoyed our stay very much! The building is very easy to locate. Our check in went very smooth. The inside of the Airbnb is very clean, the views are stunning and it’s pretty quiet! The location is great with lots of restaurants/stores around and the attractions/sites are walkable too! I also appreciate how responsive Beth is with all the questions I have. Will definitely book this Airbnb again for when we visit Calgary again next time!",
      "I had a wonderful stay! The place was perfectly located, very well maintained, tidy, and had helpful amenities that made my trip easy and comfortable. The hosts were extremely responsive and went above and beyond to help with anything that came up. Would definitely stay again — highly recommend!",
      "Great apartment - everything you need in the space, comfortable bed, good location, easy to check in! Would definitely recommend, and stay here again! Great communication with Beth as well.",
      "We loved our Calgary stay. The Airbnb was in a perfect location. The views were spectacular from the unit. All the instructions for the stay were in a convenient portal online. The building was easy to find and in a very walkable downtown. Beth was responsive and very helpful. I would highly recommend booking here if you want great views, very clean Airbnb, and lots to do within walking distance. The bed was very comfortable & the shower was nice and hot! Kitchen has everything you need!<br/>Noble Pie is the best pizza we ever ate and you can see the restaurant from the window! We were near 17 Ave where there are a ton of restaurants/bars. We went to the Prohibition Lounge for their Jazz Thursday. Also recommend the Comery Block for great BBQ/drinks!  Hudson's Canada Pub, Bottlescrew Bill's Pub, and Last Best Brewing were also nearby and great for a bite to eat and a drink. We loved everything we tried while in Downtown Calgary. We can't wait to come back and book another stay!",

      "It was a super hassle to check in. They use one of those third party apps. I was driving on highway while trying to check in because if you don’t online check in by 4 you get a late fee… when I asked questions (once because they misspoke once because I couldn’t see the tiny number at the bottom of the page) she responded in a snarky “it’s clearly laid out in the link”. The air b n b was nice however I did not find the host to be very helpful and check in is a nightmare.",
      "It was nice and comfortable. The scenery was great, we had everything we needed. They were easy to communicate. Best place to stay in calgary downtown if you wanna enjoy the view and relax.",
      "I think the best thing about this place was the view... It was breathtaking!<br/>You're approximately 10 minutes away (walking distance) from a lot of great restaurants and places to explore in Calgary.<br/>The place was perfectly described",
      "I appreciate the comfortable, clean stay! I would love to stay here again!",
      "Great place in a convenient location close to the core. Would stay again.",
      "Great location - close to downtown and the pool was perfect for the kids.",
      "Listing matches photos, clean and very comfortable. Amazing bed! And nice view from the balcony on the 15th floor of Calgary. Downtown easily accessible by walking distance. <br/>Unfortunately, the only downside to our stay and totally independent of Beth and the quality of the accommodation: a noisy neighbor until late at night, and homeless people at the foot of the building… But besides that, everything went very well!"

The building was easy to find and in a very walkable downtown. Beth was responsive and very helpful. I would highly recommend booking here if you want great views, very clean Airbnb, and lots to do within walking distance. The bed was very comfortable & the shower was nice and hot! Kitchen has everything you need!<br/>Noble Pie is the best pizza we ever ate and you can see the restaurant from the window! We were near 17 Ave where there are a ton of restaurants/bars. We went to the Prohibition Lounge for their Jazz Thursday. Also recommend the Comery Block for great BBQ/drinks!  Hudson's Canada Pub, Bottlescrew Bill's Pub, and Last Best Brewing were also nearby and great for a bite to eat and a drink. We loved everything we tried while in Downtown Calgary. We can't wait to come back and book another stay!",

Unfortunately this is a gross mischaracterization of what occurred. <br/>We send the arrival process 3 times before guests arrive and we urge them to review in advance to ensure a positive arrival experience. In this case the guest did not do that and we were happy to assist him, responding to questions within seconds. Unfortunately again he did not read the instructions even after that which led to the guest being confused, we continued to assist happily. <br/>Clarification, there is no fee if you arrive between 4pm to 10pm. Another example of the guests confusion. <br/>Once the guest arrived he was upset because he said he needed two bedrooms, which we do not advertise. <br/>We do our best to help guests and in this case it was outside of our control. <br/>Our over 6,000 reviews showcase our consistent positive guest experiences :)"

Only two blocks to popular 17th Ave. <br/>The apartment is basic but was very clean, bed was very comfortable, basic amenities for cooking, and sweet touches like welcome cookies, cold drinks & coffee. <br/>Christina was very responsive and accommodating. The price of this stay was more reasonable than most of the listings in the area. <br/>The apartment also has a nice big balcony to enjoy.",

      "This unit was so well thought through,everything we needed was provided, and the space was both functional and comfortable. The views were absolutely beautiful, and it’s clear the hosts put a lot of care into every detail. The kitchen was well-stocked, making it easy to cook and relax during our stay. Overall, a really lovely and thoughtfully designed place. We’d definitely stay here again!",
      "⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ Amazing Stay with a Stunning Downtown View!<br/>I absolutely loved my stay at this Airbnb! The highlight was definitely the breathtaking downtown Calgary view — it was beautiful both day and night. The apartment was spotless, modern, and had everything I needed for a comfortable stay. The host was friendly, responsive, and made check-in super easy. The location couldn’t be better — right in the heart of the city",
      "This place was such a lucky find! It was so beautiful! Karly had lots of nice little touches that made the place feel luxurious and comfortable. She was very responsive and checked in on us throughout our stay. The view alone was worth the money, beautiful views of the sunset from up on the 17th floor! Loved our stay and hope to be back in the future.",
      "What a view!   Beautiful condo with amazing views.  Comfortable king bed and fully stocked kitchen.  Was great to have the underground parking stall.  Thanks for a wonderful stay.",
      "I booked a different unit for an employee who was visiting town, when I found out a couple of hours before check in that the unit was no longer available. In a pinch, I booked this unit. Karly was absolutely wonderful! She was super helpful and responded to my messages promptly. She was also able to accommodate an early check in as our employee had already arrived to town and the unit was available. The unit itself was absolutely beautiful, and very clean. The pictures portray it perfectly! Our employee was very happy with this place. Highly recommended and look forward to booking here again!! Thanks Karly and Kelly!",
      "Great place. Clean, great views and overall just a stunning place. Loved everything about it",
      "Favorite place in Calgary by a far! Reasonably priced, fantastic location and an exceptional host. Thank you.",
      "We had such a wonderful stay! Karly was incredibly accommodating and communicative from start to finish, which made everything so easy. The little extras she provided were such a thoughtful touch - from the bath salts to the black makeup-removal towel (so much better than white facecloths!) to the cozy Fairmont robes. The kitchen was stocked with everything we could possibly need, and the included parking was the clincher for us.<br/>Although we were only in town for one night, we truly wished we could have stayed longer. The location is unbeatable - having lived in Calgary for three years, I can say this is the best area for restaurants, coffee shops, brewpubs, and easy access to downtown and the convention centre.<br/>We’d absolutely stay again and recommend Karly’s place to anyone visiting Calgary!",
      "very clean place in a great location right downtown. a safe place with private parking right in the building. definitely recommend and we will stay again",
      "Place is so comfy and warm. Also with downtown view is the best! I love it and I would go there again.",

The little extras she provided were such a thoughtful touch - from the bath salts to the black makeup-removal towel (so much better than white facecloths!) to the cozy Fairmont robes. The kitchen was stocked with everything we could possibly need, and the included parking was the clincher for us.<br/>Although we were only in town for one night, we truly wished we could have stayed longer. The location is unbeatable - having lived in Calgary for three years, I can say this is the best area for restaurants, coffee shops, brewpubs, and easy access to downtown and the convention centre.<br/>We’d absolutely stay again and recommend Karly’s place to anyone visiting Calgary!",

There is a decent Italian restaurant in the ground floor of the building which was super convenient. The booking process was easy. The king size bed was really comfortable and I had a great sleep. Check out was easy. I would highly recommend staying in this condo if you are visiting Calgary and I hope to return again.",

      "Check-in wasn’t as smooth as I would have liked (it took 1h total) There was a wait for the elevator as there was someone moving in. The payed parking instructions were not clear. The front desk had to tell us how their “guest parking” works. However getting in contact with host was easy and he responded/clarified the parking situation immediately. Overall place was nice and clean!",
      "even though the train tracks are there you never really heard them and the people on the streets were polite and minded there own business as long as you mind your own. the quick response times for questions the answers came quick and we're very detailed unfortunately we went when the pool was shut down because winter is coming but definitely love to check the place out again come summer check out the pool and yeah other than that everything was relaxing calm quiet unless you had the balcony door open and you heard the train",
      "This place was ideal for a two-week stay, featuring a small kitchen and a small pool for lounging. The check-in was not accessible as it requires hearing the intercom. Overall, it was very clean, in the right locations, and all amenities were provided for the stay.",
      "Moe was very helpful, flexible with our last-minute booking, and quick to respond (within 30–60 minutes) to any concerns. He made sure everything went smoothly for our stay.",
      "If you come to Calgary, you have to get this unit. It’s beautiful every time I’m in Calgary. I always get with them. The host is very responsive and very flexible.",
      "We had a wonderful time at Mo's; it was ideal for a night away! I would highly recommend his place—it's in a good  location and clean , very affordable .",
      "We enjoyed our stay at this Airbnb! The place is accessible to must see places in Calgary. Host was responsive. Security was present at all times so it felt safe.",
      "This was a great stay. <br/>Very last minute and they were able to accommodate the last minute booking. Great to deal with.",
      "Great place. Wish i lived there forever. It was amazing. Best sleep ever and he was an amazing host",
      "My wife and I stayed here during stampede week.  The condo itself was nice and was in a good location downtown to get to bars and restaurants as well as public transportation.  There are a lot of homeless in the immediate area due to bottle recycling next door, but similar to other areas downtown.  Noise was a problem the entire time we stayed, condo backs up to Badlands concert venue which has techno music playing from 6pm to 2am for the 10 days of stampede week.  The music and bass made it impossible to sleep or watch tv at night.  The venue also does random sound checks in the morning and through the day.  WiFi in the condo didn’t work well the entire time, could barely have one thing working at a time, if streaming tv, personal devices didn’t work well and vice verse.  Contacted host after second day but no improvement.  Seems like most people in the building were short term and there for stampede week as well and not actual residents.  If not for noise and wifi would’ve been great",
      "Mo’s place was great! Easy to get to and the instructions were clear. It was in a great central location and I would stay here again!",
      "Beautiful apartment with a nice view on the balcony downtown. Apartment was very clean and the hosts were quick to answer any questions we had",
      "Couple of things that can be improved<br/>- no hair dryer<br/>- shower head did not work all that well. <br/>- some of the lights weren't working in the bedroom",
      "It was a nice place to stay and Mo was a responsible host, replying most of messages and ad-hoc requests within short time. I enjoyed staying in MO’s place.",
      "Was the perfect place to stay for my solo trip, perfect location in downtown.",
      "The location was great and the bnb was a good size !!",
      "Amazing place views and stay! Highly recommended! I'll be sure to stay again",
      "Awesome appartement. Clean and the patio was a pleasant place after a long day of walk.",
      "Everything about the stay went without a hitch.   <br/>Would stay there again when in Calgary.",
      "The apartment is as described in the listing, very close to the city center that can be reached on foot without problem (about 10 minutes), it is very well-equipped, clean and close (about 400m) to bus line 300 to/from the airport.<br/>The balcony with its bench is a real plus.<br/>Mo is very responsive.<br/>Thanks for the stay.",

There are a lot of homeless in the immediate area due to bottle recycling next door, but similar to other areas downtown.  Noise was a problem the entire time we stayed, condo backs up to Badlands concert venue which has techno music playing from 6pm to 2am for the 10 days of stampede week.  The music and bass made it impossible to sleep or watch tv at night.  The venue also does random sound checks in the morning and through the day.  WiFi in the condo didn’t work well the entire time, could barely have one thing working at a time, if streaming tv, personal devices didn’t work well and vice verse.  Contacted host after second day but no improvement.  Seems like most people in the building were short term and there for stampede week as well and not actual residents.  If not for noise and wifi would’ve been great",

The only downside I would say is that there were pancakes in the microwave from the prior guest. I would recommend cleaning inside the microwave prior to the next guest. Other than that, I highly recommend! Thank you, Scott!",

The home is incredibly spacious, with modern furniture and a well-kept interior that made us feel right at home. Lisbeth was an outstanding host attentive, kind, and made sure we had everything we needed throughout our stay. The location couldn’t be better: just a short 10-minute walk to Stephen Avenue and downtown, with food and shopping amenities close by. Highly recommended!",

      "Navin was an excellent host. Very quick to respond & super friendly! My family decided to extend our trip after 1 week staying here and he was very quick to accommodate an extension. Check in and check out was super easy & the parking space was an awesome feature since we had our vehicle. Location was great with lots of restaurants nearby. Would definitely stay here again!",
      "Had a great stay at Navin’s apartment. It is in a great downtown location and is easy to walk to restaurants and bars etc.<br/>Navin gave us suggestions for places to eat and things to do in the city. I would definitely recommend his apartment if you are planning a stay in Calgary.",
      "I had a fantastic experience staying at Navin's place. The home was exactly as described—clean, and comfortable. The check-in process was smooth, and the host was responsive and helpful throughout my stay. The location was perfect—walking distance to lots of restaurants, bars, river, and park. I would absolutely stay here again and recommend it to anyone visiting Calgary.",
      "My friend and I had a great stay at Navin's place. The apartment was comfortable and welcoming. The neighbourhood was ideal: easy to get coffee in the morning, very walkable.<br/>One thing to note is that one of the bedrooms is windowless while the other bedroom is separated from the shared area by translucent sliding doors. There was no problem with privacy, but light from the shared area does diffuse through to that bedroom. So if there's anyone in the group likely to stay up late in the shared area, they should probably take that bedroom. My friend and I were both on a similar schedule so it wasn't a problem for us.<br/>Overall it was a comfortable and convenient place to stay, at a vary fair price. I'd definitely stay there again.",
      "Great spot to stay for the night! Plenty of restaurants nearby and everything was walkable. The place was super clean and we enjoyed the views from the balcony. Would stay again!",
      "Navin’s place is spotless and conveniently located within walking distance to everything! It’s just a 5-minute walk to H-Mart and Shoppers, and about 10 minutes to the train station. Navin is very responsive, and I must say, the rate I got was an absolute steal.",
      "Navin’s place was so great! It was our first time in Calgary so having the place in such a good location was super helpful. Plenty of space in the suite, and Navin was very flexible on our arrival. Thank you, Navin!",
      "Great stay. Close proximity to our event. Clear and easy check in/out. Host was very responsive and flexible.",
      "Had a great stay at Navin's - good location, walkable to 17th street, comfy beds, easy check-in and check out.",
      "Navin's place was great for our short stay. It was central to the locations we needed with parking available underground for our rental car. Navin was very responsive, including very late at night when we had to check in.<br/>We encountered a few issues with the unit as well as made some suggestions, and he addressed everything (within his power) we brought up promptly. The A/C in the unit wasn't working well the first night, but he reported this to the building owner and they seemed to get it working after the first night. It was still working partially, but Navin brought over a fan which helped immensely.<br/>He's very responsive and friendly, and although we never met in person, he helped us out a lot. Thanks, Navin!",
      "The location is in central Calgary and walkable to many restaurants and activities. Navin was very responsive to all requests and I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again.",
      "Second time staying here it is quiet and clean. Very central and close to the C train. Good value apartment",
      "The place was perfect for our getaway in Calgary. It is located in a nice area and had everything we needed. Highly recommend!",
      "Great location! We were able to walk everywhere we needed to go and having the underground parking was essential for what we needed. Navin was a great host.",
      "Navin was helpful, friendly and responsive. Checking in and out was easy. The apartment was clean and had everything we needed. The location was perfect; close to bars, restaurants, shops and very walkable to other downtown sites and activities.",
      "Navin’s place was very nice and very clean. The location was great close to a lot of restaurants and bars. Navin’s communication was also great, answered our questions almost immediately. Would definitely come back.",
      "Nice place, great view, surprisingly quiet for being downtown. The building is nice, we liked the underground parking spot. We were comfortable as soon as we got there. This was a nice place to spend some time together. Thanks!",
      "A great central place to stay, clean and quiet inside.  Access to the C-Train and eating spots was easy. One of the rooms had tinted glass sliding doors as its entrance which was fine but it would have been better to have known beforehand.",
      "We’ve stayed in this building before and love this location! Building is quiet and feels safe. UG is a huge plus! Navin was friendly and instructions were super easy to follow",
      "Great location. Navin was awesome. Very responsive. Would stay here again.",
      "Perfect location, safe area with easy access and straight forward thanks!!",
      "Had a great stay! Apartment was super clean and the host was very responsive.",
      "I stayed at Navin's place for 5 nights on a trip for work.  Overall I enjoyed the stay - Navin was very friendly and responsive with communication, the unit was very clean, and the location was very central.  It was perfect for ease of walking to work, trying out local restaurants, and the overall value was good.<br/>Reasons why I didn't give 5 stars: <br/>1) There was no coffee, which I was I was expecting based on the listing. That was a bit of a bummer since I got in late.<br/>2) The unit is plain, which is great if you're primary goal is to be out and about... but I think a bit more decoration could help elevate the vibe for time spent in the unit.",

The neighbourhood was ideal: easy to get coffee in the morning, very walkable.<br/>One thing to note is that one of the bedrooms is windowless while the other bedroom is separated from the shared area by translucent sliding doors. There was no problem with privacy, but light from the shared area does diffuse through to that bedroom. So if there's anyone in the group likely to stay up late in the shared area, they should probably take that bedroom. My friend and I were both on a similar schedule so it wasn't a problem for us.<br/>Overall it was a comfortable and convenient place to stay, at a vary fair price. I'd definitely stay there again.",

Overall I enjoyed the stay - Navin was very friendly and responsive with communication, the unit was very clean, and the location was very central.  It was perfect for ease of walking to work, trying out local restaurants, and the overall value was good.<br/>Reasons why I didn't give 5 stars: <br/>1) There was no coffee, which I was I was expecting based on the listing. That was a bit of a bummer since I got in late.<br/>2) The unit is plain, which is great if you're primary goal is to be out and about... but I think a bit more decoration could help elevate the vibe for time spent in the unit.",

Centric and well located, close walk to Calgary Transit (Train) as well as grocery store (Safeway) and an excellent choice of restaurants (Orchard, Scarpeta…) close by. Definitivelly would stay here as many times as posible. Even for a day or night in. Felt right at home.",
      "David is an absolutely great host! He was always polite, attentive, and ready to assist. The accommodation met our expectations in every possible way – it was cozy, warm, clean, and comfortable. David was very hands-on, always proactive in finding solutions to any issues. I would highly recommend him and his accommodation to anyone",
      "David and his team were amazing! Great host, very responsive and accommodating. The unit itself was comfy with nice views and walkable distance to places we needed. We had everything we needed and more! The washing machine and the dryer are massive! <br/>We actually wanted to extend our stay but unfortunately it was already booked! We will definitely want to stay here again! Thanks for having us!",
      "We had an amazing stay — the place was exactly as described (maybe even better!). Clean, comfy, and felt like a little slice of Calgary heaven.<br/>The hosts? Absolute gems. Super responsive, always helpful, and funny to boot — felt like texting a friend, not a stranger.<br/>If I'm ever back in Calgary, this is 100% where I’m staying. I hear they have other properties too... and yes, I’m already stalking them. #HostGoals",
      "Loved this place! The pictures are spot on and it was walkable to all of the things to do and places to go in downtown Calgary. The 24 hr security was a nice touch, also. When I’m in Calgary again, I’d definitely book this place!",
      "Downtown Calgary has its problems. Ok if you have a car but we didn't. Alot of homeless and troubled people in the area if you are walking. It is very central for exploring the city.",
      "David was incredibly attentive and gave ample instructions. Accommodations were exactly as described and very nice. Perfect location. Highly recommend and would stay there every time I’m in Calgary. Thanks to David and his team.",

      "This Airbnb was fantastic, spotlessly clean, modern, and fully equipped with everything you might need, including a laundry machine and dishwasher.<br/>The bed was incredibly comfortable, and the spacious balcony was perfect for relaxing and enjoying the outdoors.<br/>David was a great host, very responsive and provided clear, helpful instructions throughout our stay.<br/>While the unit doesn’t come with a designated parking spot, we had no trouble finding street parking during our entire week-long stay.",
      "Miso was amazing and this is an Airbnb that we would seek out to stay in again. It had everything we needed, the location was nice and easy to get around, and David was so communicative. <br/>The unit itself is a little smaller than we expected but it was arranged and decorated so tastefully that the size wasn't an issue whatsoever. It was absolutely beautiful inside and completely functional. <br/>Check-in and check-out were both extremely easy. This place was truly hassle-free. <br/>Thanks again to the hosts for a beautiful stay and exceptional communication!",
      "Scenic spot to see Calgary Tower. very quiet area.<br/>David is very quick to respond to questions raised. <br/>A little bit hassle for setting up the sofa bed at the first night due to no sheets ready for use, but David quickly gave instructions to find the hidden sheets in the file cabinet, extremely friendly. The file cabinet's one drawer is a little bit out of shape when we retrieved sheets for Sofa Bed. <br/>Although no parking provided by the condo, but easy to find paid street parking around and the Impark lot  82 is just cross the street.  During the evening, the streets parking is usually free, but should look at street sign carefully, especially street cleaning day.",
      "I had a wonderful two night stay at Miso while in town from Vancouver on business. This unit was surrounded by adorable cafes and restaurants and a short jaunt to some of my favourite spots in the city. The unit was clean, immaculately decorated and comfortable and the host provided excellent check In and check out instructions. Huge bonus was the cozy balcony with a beautiful view of the Calgary tower! Thanks for a great two night stay!",

      "I want to express my gratitude in advance for hosting us in your apartment. The location is excellent, and it is perfectly furnished with all the essentials we needed for these days. Congratulations on your outstanding management and organization; we hope we’ve been at least half as good guests as you are hosts. Please, if there’s anything not as per your instructions upon our departure, I’ll be happy to address it.<br/>This was my first time visiting Canada, and this apartment will always have a special place in our hearts. We prepared two excellent dinners in your kitchen and wished we could use the grill—hopefully, we’ll be back in the summer to enjoy it. We also had the pleasure of celebrating New Year’s Eve here with my fiancée’s sister and her boyfriend. Truly excellent work on your part.<br/>Thank you once again!",
      "As I travelled to visit and spend important Christmas time with my grown kids, finding a place and host that would make the experience a pleasant one VS where your staying being a detractor, especially  travelling during holidays when everything can be hectic like flight delays or missing bags, etc… this place really checked all the boxes.<br/>Very comfortably and all the items I needed to cook a full Xmas meal, for a very descent rate$ in a central and accessible location.<br/>Most of all, David and his team are one of the best super hosts iv booked with to date.<br/>Friendly yes, professional and very quick response time and accommodating.<br/>His respectful and understanding approach to my needs were especially appreciated, as well having received the same level from his whole team.<br/>Need I say more. <br/>Thank you."

The file cabinet's one drawer is a little bit out of shape when we retrieved sheets for Sofa Bed. <br/>Although no parking provided by the condo, but easy to find paid street parking around and the Impark lot  82 is just cross the street.  During the evening, the streets parking is usually free, but should look at street sign carefully, especially street cleaning day.",

      "I stayed here for 5 nights a my Mom. Always a treat getting to spend time with her, and staying at Chloe and Jason’s for the bill perfectly. <br/>There’s a lot going on in the neighborhood. Good restaurants and bars, real businesses, and other residential projects. I was able to walk to my morning meetings downtown in no time. 17th Street is also just a quick walk with more bars and restaurants and even a pharmacy. <br/>The suite is generous and beautiful. It’s very well designed and the two balconies face South and East. This isn’t your typical condo project - you don’t have to leave your room to change your mind :)<br/>Chloe and Jason made sure everything was taken care of and responded inside of 10 minutes and sometimes immediately. It was very reliable communication.  <br/>Plenty of pillows and comfortable bedding to melt into after marathon days.",
      "I wanted to share my stay in this apartment. The apartment was fabulous. The booking went smooth. I give them 5/5 but I faced a scary experience with the building itself. They have two garages in the underground parking. The main one and there's another trap metal door the further you drive down. If you drive an SUV it will give a small height space. I drove through this trap door following another car infront of me with a reasonable allowance. I followed since I was close to the car and the door was fully open when I looked. As I was in the middle I heard a sound that was the metal door hitting the top of my Audi q7 shattering the top of my windshield. Thankfully I was not injured but my hope through this message is that people will be careful with the garage when they stay at this location.<br/>Thanks,<br/>Moira",
      "What a great view!! We enjoyed this condo and super easy to get around downtown",
      "Great place for the price! We enjoyed our stay and the views of both the mountains and the city skyline. Comfortable furniture as well.",
      "The place is extremely beautiful, very clean and perfect location. The view is extraordinary and we are looking forward to come back. We strongly recomand it to others",
      "We had a great time at this location. Everything was really close, and the view was unforgettable.",
      "We had a great stay at this Airbnb! The host was super friendly and very responsive throughout our stay. The unit was clean, well-maintained, and comfortably fit five people. The check-in process was very clear and smooth, and overall, we’re really happy with our experience.<br/>One suggestion for the host: the checkout instructions ask guests to pile up used towels, linens, and rags in the bedroom. While it’s understandable to help the cleaning staff identify used items, I’d personally prefer if the host’s team handled that entirely to avoid any hygiene issues—especially since guests might accidentally forget something.<br/>Also worth mentioning (as other reviews have noted), there are some homeless people around the neighborhood, but this didn’t affect our stay and is, of course, outside the host’s control.<br/>Overall, we’d definitely recommend this place and would stay again!",
      "We were honestly quite disappointed with our 2-night stay, mainly because of two things. First, when we arrived, the master bedroom wasn’t clean at all. the floor was still dirty, like it hadn’t even been swept. The towels also smelled bad and we had to wash them before using them. The sofa in the living room also had an unpleasant smell which made it uncomfortable to sit on.<br/>Second, the TV wasn’t working the whole time we were there. We were told it was already having issues and still being fixed but we feel like it should have been sorted out before our check-in. We were told multiple times that someone would come by to fix it, so we waited the whole day but no one showed up. That was really frustrating.<br/>We paid the full price expecting a relaxing stay, but instead, it ended up being stressful. Please make sure the place is fully cleaned and ready before guests arrive. The thing is, the unit itself is actually nice and the view is beautiful. It just needs be maintained well.",
      "This property was exactly what I needed during my stay in Calgary: spacious, well-equipped, and ideally located. <br/>While the check-in process may seem a bit tricky at first, the hosts have provided an incredibly detailed and clear PDF guide that makes everything smooth and straightforward. Once inside, the space far exceeded my expectations, with stunning views and thoughtful touches throughout.<br/>It's worth noting that some of the surrounding area faces social challenges, which are beyond the hosts’ control, just something to be aware of. That said, the secure parking and overall convenience of the location more than made up for it. <br/>I genuinely appreciated the care and effort the hosts put into making this a great stay.<br/>Thanks again, and hats off to the hosts for doing such a great job. Keep it up!",
      "One of the Best building in Downtown area, the best view and location",
      "Chloe and Jason were good hosts I’ll visit again.",
      "Overall, the room is spacious and clean.They responded very quickly and were very friendly.The location is also very good, and you can walk to the nearby supermarket and restaurants.<br/>The minor complaints were that there was no hair dryer, Netflix could not be watched in the designated way, there were no tissues, and the neighbors and surroundings were noisy until the middle of the night on Saturday night.<br/>But I don't have any major complaints.<br/>We have a very good place to stay.",

Always a treat getting to spend time with her, and staying at Chloe and Jason’s for the bill perfectly. <br/>There’s a lot going on in the neighborhood. Good restaurants and bars, real businesses, and other residential projects. I was able to walk to my morning meetings downtown in no time. 17th Street is also just a quick walk with more bars and restaurants and even a pharmacy. <br/>The suite is generous and beautiful. It’s very well designed and the two balconies face South and East. This isn’t your typical condo project - you don’t have to leave your room to change your mind :)<br/>Chloe and Jason made sure everything was taken care of and responded inside of 10 minutes and sometimes immediately. It was very reliable communication.  <br/>Plenty of pillows and comfortable bedding to melt into after marathon days.",

        "review": "I wanted to share my stay in this apartment. The apartment was fabulous. The booking went smooth. I give them 5/5 but I faced a scary experience with the building itself. They have two garages in the underground parking. The main one and there's another trap metal door the further you drive down. If you drive an SUV it will give a small height space. I drove through this trap door following another car infront of me with a reasonable allowance. I followed since I was close to the car and the door was fully open when I looked. As I was in the middle I heard a sound that was the metal door hitting the top of my Audi q7 shattering the top of my windshield. Thankfully I was not injured but my hope through this message is that people will be careful with the garage when they stay at this location.<br/>Thanks,<br/>Moira",

The check-in process was very clear and smooth, and overall, we’re really happy with our experience.<br/>One suggestion for the host: the checkout instructions ask guests to pile up used towels, linens, and rags in the bedroom. While it’s understandable to help the cleaning staff identify used items, I’d personally prefer if the host’s team handled that entirely to avoid any hygiene issues—especially since guests might accidentally forget something.<br/>Also worth mentioning (as other reviews have noted), there are some homeless people around the neighborhood, but this didn’t affect our stay and is, of course, outside the host’s control.<br/>Overall, we’d definitely recommend this place and would stay again!",

First, when we arrived, the master bedroom wasn’t clean at all. the floor was still dirty, like it hadn’t even been swept. The towels also smelled bad and we had to wash them before using them. The sofa in the living room also had an unpleasant smell which made it uncomfortable to sit on.<br/>Second, the TV wasn’t working the whole time we were there. We were told it was already having issues and still being fixed but we feel like it should have been sorted out before our check-in. We were told multiple times that someone would come by to fix it, so we waited the whole day but no one showed up. That was really frustrating.<br/>We paid the full price expecting a relaxing stay, but instead, it ended up being stressful. Please make sure the place is fully cleaned and ready before guests arrive. The thing is, the unit itself is actually nice and the view is beautiful. It just needs be maintained well.",

Once inside, the space far exceeded my expectations, with stunning views and thoughtful touches throughout.<br/>It's worth noting that some of the surrounding area faces social challenges, which are beyond the hosts’ control, just something to be aware of. That said, the secure parking and overall convenience of the location more than made up for it. <br/>I genuinely appreciated the care and effort the hosts put into making this a great stay.<br/>Thanks again, and hats off to the hosts for doing such a great job.

      "Booked this BnB for a nice quiet gateway. The room was not so clean, had debris and dirt over the floors. The view was the only outstanding part of the apartment. We hardly got any sleep in due to the party happening. The closest was pre-broken when we got to the bnb, definitely does not match the pictures. I wouldn’t book again if I was looking for comfort. I will definitely book for the view. The communication between the host was smooth.",
      "I had a fantastic stay here. The location is amazing - clear views of the Calgary tower from all areas of the condo. <br/>The unit was clean, and communication from the hosts was very warm and near instant throughout the experience, which took a lot of stress off of the trip. <br/>Kudos to the team, I enjoyed my stay and will be back. <br/>Thanks again!",

      "Pros... there are many:<br/>Best thing about this place is the full view of the city from both the lounge and the bedroom - I couldn't get enough of it!<br/>Place is much as pictured, photos are glossier and make it seem a bit bigger/ brighter. It's still a beautiful place, even without the gloss.<br/>Check in was simple and contactless.<br/>Everything was clean<br/>Appreciated the Tim Hortons coffee pods every morning :)<br/>Nice Japanese restaurant/ bento place nearby, and a convenient walk/ ride to Stephen Avenue. <br/>Bed was very comfy, and there's loads of storage space.<br/>-Shower head - please replace asap as that one is unusable - used the bottom tap which was frustrating.<br/>- Soap dispenser - pump did not work throughout my stay<br/>- Some sockets in bedroom don't work<br/>- Not a major issue for me, but  bedroom closet door is broken and leans on a wall<br/>-Communication was prompt, except near check-out; requested delayed check out and had to follow up next day. Declined, so had to leave sharpish!",

It's still a beautiful place, even without the gloss.<br/>Check in was simple and contactless.<br/>Everything was clean<br/>Appreciated the Tim Hortons coffee pods every morning :)<br/>Nice Japanese restaurant/ bento place nearby, and a convenient walk/ ride to Stephen Avenue. <br/>Bed was very comfy, and there's loads of storage space.<br/>-Shower head - please replace asap as that one is unusable - used the bottom tap which was frustrating.<br/>- Soap dispenser - pump did not work throughout my stay<br/>- Some sockets in bedroom don't work<br/>- Not a major issue for me, but  bedroom closet door is broken and leans on a wall<br/>-Communication was prompt, except near check-out; requested delayed check out and had to follow up next day.
