      "Nice place in a great area. Parking was excellent as spot is 20 steps from your door. Beds were quite comfortable and kitchen was stocked with everything you need. The area is pretty noisy at night but being downtown it should be expected. We really enjoyed our stay and would definitely stay again. Thank you Tristan",
      "The location was perfect for our stay. We attended a festival at Cowboy Park which was approximately a 15 min walk from this place. There is a lot of places to eat close by and within walking distance. The parking spot and street parking are both convenient and felt safe. The instructions into the building were a little confusing but we managed. Overall, we would definitely stay again and would recommend the space.",
      "Tristan\u2019s place is fantastic! Great furnishings and comfortable beds. The location is close to wonderful restaurants and coffeehouses. It is close to lots of things to do yet tucked in a quiet street. The parking stall was very appreciated. Thanks Tristan!",
      "Great value for money, the apartment was beautiful and had everything you need. Tristan was very responsive and helpful, I\u2019d definitely stay again if I came back to Calgary",
      "Our stay was wonderful, it\u2019s a nice fancy safe place by the heart of downtown, only 5 minutes from Calgary tower and 5 to 6 minutes away from two downtown mosques in Calgary.",
      "We had a wonderful stay at Tristan\u2019s place in Calgary! The house was clean, secure, and beautifully maintained. It looked just like the photos, if not better. Tristan was an excellent host, very welcoming and quick to respond to our messages. We truly felt comfortable and well taken care of throughout our stay.<br/>Will definitely recommend this place to all our friends and family in Saskatoon!",
      "Pros:Great location! Beds were comfy. very little required from us to check out which was appreciated. <br/>Con:Pictures did not meet the actual place (small apartment) The work space is in the living room right next to the only TV, Sofa and access to the balcony. So if one of you is working the other person will have to be in one of the bedrooms.",
      "Very good spot, very centric.  It has been a good experience. The flat is comfortable and nice. Recommendable.<br/>Unfortunately, there was a fire alarm inspection during our stay. We couldn\u2019t access to the rooftop.<br/>The price is a bit high comparing to other places, but it is true that is in Calgary Downtown and during the summer.",
      "This place was amazing and the hosts had the two most important qualities I like to see: responsive and friendly. From the property you can get anywhere downtown in about 10 mins driving and there are a ton of things within a 5 to 10 min walk. It is in a safe neighborhood and while we were there it was quiet and peaceful. If you are looking for an affordable clean place to stay with responsive hosts then I recomend!",
      "Host was very communicative and responsive. Location is awesome and the place was accurately represented in the photos. <br/>**IMPORTANT** This building is VERY strict on noise. We were threatened by a resident at 3 pm in the afternoon because we were playing music and we talked in halls. We felt like we were walking on eggshells for the remainder of our stay. This place is suitable as a landing spot for a quiet group, but I would not recommend if you\u2019re looking for a place that feels like home.",
      "Had some issues with the check in process due to a miscommunication on the host's part, but apart from that rough start, it was overall a great place (clean, quiet, good location).",
      "Really loved the location!  Very convenient to 17th Avenue with tons of restaurant options and shopping.  In the other direction, it was a short walk to the Central Library and the incredible murals all over Calgary!",
      "Tristan was friendly and communicative our whole stay - always reaching out to make sure everything was going okay. :) Great host!",
      "Great stay, proactive and responsive hosts, everything is exactly same as listed, thanks for hosting us.",
      "I found Tristan\u2019s place an absolute diamond of a find! It was so secure and private, in a great location walkable to the bustling streets for restaurants and shops. The apartment was pristine and beautifully furnished, the kitchen was kitted out and very well stocked. The owners were so helpful and kind also. Such good value for money and will definitely stay again when I\u2019m back in Calgary. Couldn\u2019t recommend more highly! :)",
      "Second time staying here. Great location and awesome host. Highly recommended and definitely stay here next time!",
      "The lodging matched the photos and description. We liked the apartment and the location. The price was very reasonable. We had 5 ppl stay comfortably. My reasons for not giving 5 stars is the fairly unreasonable quiet hours and the manner we were treated by other residents. And the serious amount of door locks and security was at times frustrating. It was hard to get in and out with all the keys fobs locks buttons and doors. If you intend to have a very quiet stay and few occupants this prob would be a great choice. If you wanna hang here and enjoy a few laughs in the middle of the day be prepared for noise disturbance complaints both from residents and an in house monitor system. The host was great and very good communicator. I just would not bring a group here. Beds were ok, but not great. Bathroom and kitchen very nice. Great location in Calgary. Cute place.  I\u2019m sad we never went to the rooftop. We used the parking garage spot which was very convenient.",
      "Great place to stay in downtown Calgary. Great neighbourhood, close to shops. Highly recommended.",
      "Great experience! Highly recommend. Beautiful apartment and host was extremely helpful. Wish we stayed longer!",
      "We booked  staff members in Tristan\u2019s place and they had a wonderful experience.  Very happy with their accommodations and how well Tristan communicated.",
      "Excellent place to stay in Calgary. Very peaceful area, yet walkable to a ton of places in the area. The apartment was exactly as described, and the parking was great for a Full size F150 truck. The unit matched the pictures and descriptions, and the hosts were excellent.",
      "nice quiet location. Walking distance to everything I needed - safeway is just around the corner.<br/>I stayed 2 weeks and it was homey.<br/>I loved it so much I am coming back for work for 3 week and booked it again.<br/>Kenzie was a gem to deal with.",
      "Clean , convenient and good fare pricing",
      "Very clean and well located place to stay in Calgary."

My reasons for not giving 5 stars is the fairly unreasonable quiet hours and the manner we were treated by other residents. And the serious amount of door locks and security was at times frustrating. It was hard to get in and out with all the keys fobs locks buttons and doors. If you intend to have a very quiet stay and few occupants this prob would be a great choice. If you wanna hang here and enjoy a few laughs in the middle of the day be prepared for noise disturbance complaints both from residents and an in house monitor system. The host was great and very good communicator. I just would not bring a group here. Beds were ok, but not great. Bathroom and kitchen very nice. Great location in Calgary. Cute place.  I\u2019m sad we never went to the rooftop. We used the parking garage spot which was very convenient.",
        "host_response": "Thank you for your thoughtful review and for choosing to stay with us! We\u2019re so glad to hear you enjoyed the apartment, appreciated the location, and found the parking convenient. It\u2019s great to know the space comfortably accommodated your group and that communication was smooth throughout your stay.<br/>We did want to kindly clarify a few points for future guests:<br/>- The noise monitoring system is designed to only alert us of prolonged elevated noise levels, not brief or typical sounds of enjoyment.<br/>- Quiet hours begin at 9 PM on weekdays, which is just one hour earlier than Calgary\u2019s bylaw, and are in place to maintain a respectful environment for all residents.<br/>- We\u2019ve also recently streamlined our check-in process, reducing the number of steps and making it easier to navigate the building.<br/>We appreciate your feedback and are always looking for ways to improve. Thanks again for staying with us and for your honest insights!"
