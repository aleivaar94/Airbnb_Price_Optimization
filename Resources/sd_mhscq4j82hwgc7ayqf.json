      "Both Tristian and Kenzi were super helpful checking in! Older building so some finesse required to use the intercom (disconnects) but Tristian and Kenzie were there to safe the day and do a work around. Super grateful for their prompt response after my gfs and I decided our BC road trip needed a rest stop in Alberta before we continued on. Good call on this air bnb!",
      "I stay here frequently for business and always enjoy the place.  The location is great, walking distance to downtown, the Saddle Dome, BMO Centre, and tons of top notch restaurants in and around the beltline.  Clean and comfortable place, would recommend and the owner friendly, helpful and prompt to reply if any issues or questions arise.",
      "Tristin’s place is in a wonderful location! It’s within walking distance to restaurants, bars and shopping!  The unit had everything we needed to make simple meals. It’s the perfect location for day trips as well. If you’re a light sleeper bring some earplugs for the weekends. The rest of the week was fine. We loved our stay in Calgary. It’s a beautiful city.",
      "Tristan and his partner came to my rescue when I desperately needed a same day, last minute booking for a few nights. They went out of their way to ensure I could check in early, and we're responsive and helpful throughout, checking in on things without overbearing. I would gladly stay at this or any other spaces they are hosts of after this experience and recommend others do as well.",
      "Tristan was very responsive and gave clear check-in instructions that made the process easy. The apartment was clean and comfortable. The location was great with lots to do and within walking distance. Would stay here again!",
      "The condo is in an area with excellent walk ability. Few<br/>minutes from the Riverwalk, easy to walk over the 17th & 4th area . Drivable location as well, very little traffic, parking safe & secure. The two bedroom condo is comfortable , clean & great location. Will definitely book again next time in Calgary. Tristan is an accessible host providing detailed instructions, information and checking in to answer any questions.",
      "This is a great choice in Calgary. The building is located in a really walkable neighborhood, convenient to downtown and to the 17th Street businesses. Walkable to the off-leash dog park on the Elbow River. Many restaurants and bars. The hosts were very responsive and communicative. Great view from the unit, including a bit of the mountains. Indoor parking is a nice feature for security and in the winter weather.",
      "Great location. Lots of great restaurants and coffee shops nearby. Easy walk to a lot of sights downtown (Calgary Tower, Olympic Plaza, Core Shopping Ctr). Very proactive Host. Unit was comfortable with a very good kitchen set-up. Only negative was that the unit didn't have great lighting but I guess most guests are not coming for an end of November stay.",
      "The unit is amazing - clean, tidy, and all around a comfortable stay. Check-in was very easy, despite a little hiccup, and they were flexible with the time. The hosts were also great communicators. I appreciated that the space accommodated for little ones (e.g. kiddie cups, socket covers, pack n play). Great location in the downtown core, and is a short walk to many places and amenities. 100% recommend 👍🏻",

      "My friends & I were lucky enough to have the opportunity to stay at Tristan’s AirBnB. The place was in a great location, with lots of amenities near by.

The floor to ceiling windows offer a stunning panorama of the city and gorgeous natural light - but it does mean the secondary bedroom is a brighter sleep space.

      "We found Ahmed’s place an excellent location for our one night stay in Calgary. We appreciated being able to use the parking space after check out. Ahmed very kindly provided details of local beauty salons.<br/>However the bathroom was not the cleanest with hair on the floor and the towels smelled.<br/>We still recommend Ahmed’s place as he is very obliging.",
      "We only stayed one night at Ahmed's place but could easily have stayed longer. Ahmed is a really nice guy too. His apartment has everything you need and offers great downtown views. There is a really nice Italian restaurant attached to the building that serves excellent food.  Thank you again Amed! 😊",
      "Ahmed was a great host! The place was nice and cozy with great views! He helped me set up  a nice and pleasant surprise for my wife’s birthday which we were celebrating in Calgary. He went over and beyond with all my requests! Would love to be his guest again! Highly recommend!",
      "This place was absolutely breathtaking! Ahmed was an amazing host, kind, helpful and responsive. <br/>The place was clean, smelt great and had a homey feeling to it. Would come back here if we ever took another trip to Calgary! Thank you!!",

And the view is beautiful especially sitting in the egg chair swing on the balcony. Definitely a cool experience for country people who’ve never stayed downtown big city.",
      "Ahmed is the type of host you want with any air bnb you stay at. Very well at communication and the condo exceeded all expectations. We will be returning for sure! This home made our trip unforgettable.",

      "A lovely apartment in a convenient location. Ahmed is communicative and accommodating! All the toiletries you could ever need available in the bathroom.",
      "An amazing experience made special because of the caring host Ahmed. The location was perfect, the home was cozy and clean, and Ahmed was always available to answer questions. The check-in was smooth. The apartment building is secure. We were in a strife as our luggage was damaged in transit & Ahmed was very helpful. He went out of his way to take us luggage shopping & dropped us back to the apartment. He always checked in on us to make sure we were comfortable. We felt comfortable in Ahmed’s apartment & this enhanced our stay. “Highly recommend” Our stay at Ahmed’s apartment place and will not hesitate to stay here again. Thank you Ahmed for your kindness.",
      "We had such a great stay at Ahmed’s place! The apartment complex was well secured & felt safe, and the bed was extremely cozy. The view at night from the balcony was also beautiful (we loved being able to see the Calgary Tower!) we were so close to bars and restaurants, and were able to easily walk around! Highly recommend this stay and would definitely come back if we are ever in the area again!",
      "The place was very clean and the decor made it feel nice and homey. The location was awesome! We walked to all restaurants and most attractions, there was always electric scooters outside the door to hop on and explore downtown. <br/>Our host was great with responding to any questions, check-in and check-out was a breeze! <br/>Will definitely stay again when visiting Calgary",
      "Absolutely recommend this place! The view is amazing, especially at night. Very clean when we arrived and is in a great location as it’s right downtown. Ahmed was very communicative and even brought us a bottle of champagne as a gift for my boyfriend’s birthday! Overall worth the money paid and would stay again. Thanks!",
      "He wasn't lying about the view, it's stunning. We loved the large porch as well.",
      "Cute condo in convenient location. Ahmed was very helpful and communicative. It was a good experience overall.",
      "Would highly recommend a stay here if you’re looking to explore downtown calgary! It’s only a few blocks away from tons of restaurants, bars, and the calgary tower. Easy and free parking, and awesome decor inside the unit. Super clean, and Ahmed was extremely friendly and helpful!",
      "Ahmed was a wonderful host!!  Our stay was fantastic.  Everything was easily accessible. We made reservations at Major Tom's.  (Absolutely amazing dining experience!). Ahmed has a bed that is so comfortable and firm. Myself being a bigger guy who needs a good firm bed for a decent night's sleep. Woke up feeling fresh!! The views at night from Ahmeds are spectacular.  Very happy we stayed there, we will definitely be returning!! Thank you for everything Ahmed!!",
      "The place was in the centre of the city and had a lot of restaurants near by! Also fairly easy check in process, and he had good communication. Could use some more basic amenities such as more towels and a blow dryer, but overall a great spot.",
      "I had a great stay at the condo! It was clean, well-maintained, and had easy access to everything I needed. The location was perfect, and I felt right at home throughout my visit. Highly recommend!",

He went out of his way to take us luggage shopping & dropped us back to the apartment. He always checked in on us to make sure we were comfortable.

      "The place is beautiful and comfortable. Loved living in the heart of Downtown. Apartment had more space than we expected. Perfect for family stays…will definitely love to stay again in future.",
      "Had a great stay! Was easy to access instructions on check-in were clear. We did have one hiccup on check out though as we were instructed to leave the keys in the unit but it was not made clear that you need to get your car out of the parkade before leaving the keys behind. We got stranded in the lobby and couldn’t get back up to the unit as we didn’t have the fob, also couldn’t get down into the parkade without the fob. Luckily a gentleman who lives in the building was nice enough to let us into the parkade to get our vehicle. Other than this the unit was decent and overall quite clean. I would happily stay here again.",
      "This was by far the worst Airbnb I’ve stayed in & I do not recommend it. After booking, we learned check-in required walking 10 minutes to another location to pick up keys. The provided link for underground parking was useless; no payment option existed so we had to park on the street. Upon entry, we were met with an overwhelming odor of cigarette smoke & a hockey gym bag that lingered in the bedding, towels & furniture. Cleanliness was nonexistent - crumbs, stains, a dirty Kleenex under the uncomfortable couch that had a metal rod running throughout. Hair & dirt on the rug, random stains on the bedding, walls & ceiling, & dust on nearly every surface. A sticker on the fridge telling guests to leave high ratings felt highly inappropriate. After only 2 hours, we left & booked a hotel at 3 a.m. Hosts showed zero concern for our experience & only cared about the keys.Unclean, unprofessional - never again. Only pro was location. I’d have a lot more to say more if there weren’t a word count",
      "Really enjoyed my stay the place was great great location very clean. Everything worked. Would love to stay again.",
      "Well,I found this place is very affordable and close to all locations like restaurants,mall and so many places to visit.<br/>Place is really nice and peaceful.Everything well organized and I will definitely love to rebook if I get a chance to come to Calgary again.",
      "Will come again soon! Samantha is awesome host!!!!",
      "Great place and close to everything. Would easily come back if visiting Calgary again",
      "Pros: Great location—walking distance to bars, restaurants, and downtown/17th Ave. The unit is clean, well-maintained, and looks like the photos. Secure building with easy check-in.<br/>Cons: The unit lacks warmth and feels bare. The couch is stiff and uncomfortable, with metal bars running through the cushions. The kitchen is poorly stocked—no ice trays and minimal essentials, making it impractical for cooking.<br/>The real issue? Greed. I had a medical emergency during the first night and had to leave for the hospital, meaning I never even stayed in the unit. Despite this, the host refused a date change, even though it was Valentine’s Day weekend and could have been rebooked. Worse, they changed the door code without notice, locking me out for 1.5 hours when I returned for my luggage. I was still charged a full cleaning fee for a unit I barely used.<br/>Overall: The unit itself is decent, but the host’s lack of empathy and money-first attitude left me with a bad impression :(",
      "Amazing place great host would stay again",
      "Great apartment!",
      "We had an amazing stay, and would stay here again in the future if able to, the place is even better in person and is right in the heart of downtown Calgary making it very easy to get around the area with plenty of things to do.",
      "Condo was clean and comfortable and hosts are very responsive. <br/>Little bit of a surprise to find we couldn’t park in underground parking until paying an additional fee after we’d already got into the condo (maybe I missed that in the description?) , but once that was sorted everything else was seamless. <br/>Hosts were quick to respond when we messaged and checked in later that day to make sure everything was going alright. <br/>Great hosts and a nice place in a convenient location.",
      "Overall really great stay!! So much to do in the area, great location to walk from, enjoy restaurants and downtown. Ample towels and other amenities.  Great value, great location and would recommend.",
      "We enjoyed our stay here. The hosts are quick to respond and helpful when needed. The condo met our needs: the location was fantastic and the space was well laid out and decorated.",
      "Super nice place",
      "Great location and very easy to get around the City.<br/>Very cozy and well maintained.<br/>Would stay there again.",
      "From start to finish this was a pretty terrible experience. The hosts was not flexible with the check-in time and only provided check-in instructions 2 hours or so before the designated time. There was only 1 set of keys available for 3 people which was very surprising given that the place is listed to accommodate 4. The host was unable to provide an extra set of keys despite asking for this in advance. Then, the AC was broken and the condo was at 28.5 degrees, which was completely uninhabitable. For 4 (business) days the host was saying it was being repaired and a technician was coming, but no one ever showed up. The host clearly had no intention of ever fixing anything and I am pretty sure I was speaking with an AI for the most part. Would not recommend, it was completely unreasonable to live in a condo at 28.5 degrees and the host misled us in saying it was being repaired.",
      "Great location. Host was helpful. I would stay here again. Thank you",
      "One of the best Airbnb for games nights spacious, clean and at-home-vibe",
      "Place was cozy, clean and in an ideal location.  I would rebook again.",
      "Very friendly owners. Enjoyed staying here all weekend. The building is quiet too.",
      "Great location to explore downtown Calgary.",
      "highly recommend would definitely stay again",
      "Very beautiful apartment, clean and spacious, conveniently located near shops and restaurants close to commercial downtown.<br/>The building is beautiful with a peaceful atmosphere.<br/>Host was cordial and helpful.<br/>We would stay again any time."

We did have one hiccup on check out though as we were instructed to leave the keys in the unit but it was not made clear that you need to get your car out of the parkade before leaving the keys behind. We got stranded in the lobby and couldn’t get back up to the unit as we didn’t have the fob, also couldn’t get down into the parkade without the fob. Luckily a gentleman who lives in the building was nice enough to let us into the parkade to get our vehicle. Other than this the unit was decent and overall quite clean. I would happily stay here again.",

The provided link for underground parking was useless; no payment option existed so we had to park on the street. Upon entry, we were met with an overwhelming odor of cigarette smoke & a hockey gym bag that lingered in the bedding, towels & furniture. Cleanliness was nonexistent - crumbs, stains, a dirty Kleenex under the uncomfortable couch that had a metal rod running throughout. Hair & dirt on the rug, random stains on the bedding, walls & ceiling, & dust on nearly every surface. A sticker on the fridge telling guests to leave high ratings felt highly inappropriate. After only 2 hours, we left & booked a hotel at 3 a.m. Hosts showed zero concern for our experience & only cared about the keys.Unclean, unprofessional - never again. Only pro was location. I’d have a lot more to say more if there weren’t a word count",

Secure building with easy check-in.<br/>Cons: The unit lacks warmth and feels bare. The couch is stiff and uncomfortable, with metal bars running through the cushions. The kitchen is poorly stocked—no ice trays and minimal essentials, making it impractical for cooking.<br/>The real issue? Greed. I had a medical emergency during the first night and had to leave for the hospital, meaning I never even stayed in the unit. Despite this, the host refused a date change, even though it was Valentine’s Day weekend and could have been rebooked. Worse, they changed the door code without notice, locking me out for 1.5 hours when I returned for my luggage. I was still charged a full cleaning fee for a unit I barely used.<br/>Overall: The unit itself is decent, but the host’s lack of empathy and money-first attitude left me with a bad impression :(",

The hosts was not flexible with the check-in time and only provided check-in instructions 2 hours or so before the designated time. There was only 1 set of keys available for 3 people which was very surprising given that the place is listed to accommodate 4. The host was unable to provide an extra set of keys despite asking for this in advance. Then, the AC was broken and the condo was at 28.5 degrees, which was completely uninhabitable. For 4 (business) days the host was saying it was being repaired and a technician was coming, but no one ever showed up. The host clearly had no intention of ever fixing anything and I am pretty sure I was speaking with an AI for the most part. Would not recommend, it was completely unreasonable to live in a condo at 28.5 degrees and the host misled us in saying it was being repaired.",

      "Great location just off 17th Avenue with loads of great bars and restaurants. Host was brilliant with any questions I had really responsive. It’s a bit of a basic apartment but for the money I think it’s great value and has everything you need. Will definitely be staying again next time I’m in Calgary.",
      "we had a great time at this apartment! the location was ideal for food and access to groceries. parking was all good. <br/>the apartment is spacious with lots of closet space. the shower was great<br/>the bed and couch were pretty hard and not super comfy, and the building is definitely old and smells like cigs. <br/>but for the price, this place was an excellent home for us for the week!",
      "The location was prime, only a couple minutes from continental store, coffee, less than 10 minutes from the main roads with tons of restaurants. Cute little place :) and Liana was so kind about checking out an hour late!",
      "Excellent location! As others have said, the building is a bit run down but the one bedroom apartment has what you need to spend a couple of days. The best thing about this place is the location and transit accessibility.",
      "Bed was super comfortable. <br/>Never heard a peek from neighbors or other guests.<br/>Great Value and Perfect Location!",
      "Great place to stay, close to all amenities , thanks Liana. U were easy to get a hold of gor inquiries",
      "Not the best experience but host tried to be accommodating so that’s appreciated. Great location in terms of being downtown but not the best neighbourhood either.",
      "Place in a good location, accesible, affordable.  I would have liked the sheets to be clean.",
      "Prime location,  quiet place and Lina is always cooperative",
      "In a good location to do things downtown. You get what you pay for.",
      "Nice apartment in a great location.",
      "Great location, easy check in.. hassle free stay",
      "Very nice host !",
      "Was a great location but when I got to the place there was no toilet paper. Not sure if that’s normal. Every other place I’ve been to had that supplied. Could have been cleaner too. Lots to do though in that specific area.",
      "Beautiful apartment in a quieter area while still being close to 17th Ave. Liana was incredibly responsive and proactive with any questions or problems I brought up to her. It wasn’t the first time staying at a place she hosts and it won’t be the last! Highly recommend!",
      "Place was as described. Some ppl were cooking strong smelling meals or smoking weed, the apartment door could be sealed better to keep these smells out.<br/>Host friendly and responsive.",
      "Located in the vibrant downtown of Calgary, just off of  the 17th avenue strip, surrounded by bars and restaurants,  the location was transit accessible and perfect for us. Its very busy so if youre into peace and quiet, it might not be 100% perfect for you, but it was not a big issue for us personally. <br/>As for the apartment, it was better than we anticipated for the price, but it is in a bit of a rough building.  The rooms were sufficiently clean with utensils and cooking appliances available + some ingredients as well. <br/>Overall, it was a very pleasant stay. Would recommend if youre looking for affordable accommodation.",
      "This suite is in an older building that shows its wear, but the unit is acceptable and is located within walking distance of 17 Ave SW. This place needs a little TLC.",
      "Very convenient location close to shops and restaurants in the downtown Calgary area. A bright comfortable space that is good for someone on a budget.",
      "The apartment is great for the price and well located. It would be nice to pay more attention to the cleaning especially of the bathroom which was quite dusty.",
      "My friend and I wanted another fan. Liana responded fairly quick and got us one. Great location, cute little apartment. I recommend it.",
      "great bed and kitchen, geary peaceful and easy to walk or take transit. there is also street parking.",
      "its a cute and cozy place. The bed was very comfortable. It was great to have a kitchen to cook meals.",
      "I liked the proximity to downtown and the fact that it is private."

Its very busy so if youre into peace and quiet, it might not be 100% perfect for you, but it was not a big issue for us personally. <br/>As for the apartment, it was better than we anticipated for the price, but it is in a bit of a rough building.  The rooms were sufficiently clean with utensils and cooking appliances available + some ingredients as well. <br/>Overall, it was a very pleasant stay. Would recommend if youre looking for affordable accommodation.",

      "I loved my stay! Being downtown was very convenient, parking was accessible as well as a very clean and beautiful apartment. Host was very responsive and delightful to communicate with, I would heavily recommend this place and if I’m ever needing to stay in Calgary again I will find myself revisiting this listing. Overall it was a very beautiful and peaceful stay.",
      "Wow this place has been the most beautiful place I have ever stayed in. The views are incredible. I wanted to hurry back to the suite just so I can enjoy the space. I love how everything just felt like home and looked modern. You must stay here!!",
      "We stayed during Stampede and anticipated noise and party goers. We were not disappointed. Check-in and checkout are involved and mildly tedious but VERY well described. Lovely space. Great views. Allow extra time for checking and checkout as two trips up the elevator to the 30th floor are required for both. Would stay again.",
      "Beth and her team did a great job of providing instructions ahead of time, they were clear and easy to follow making the check in and check out process super easy. Host was super proactive and responsive. <br/>Condo was clean and in a good location. Great views of Calgary downtown. We only stayed the one night but would definitely stay here again!",
      "An absolute gem. Have been here before. Return customer. Excellent stay. Sub-penthouse provides exceptional views of DT, close to restaurants and everything. Underground parking. Private, secure and convenient to everything. Host is fantastic, friendly, responsive and helpful. I’ll be back for sure! Highly recommend this place. Great value, amazing stay!",
      "From start to finish the host was so onto of our every question and need . The service and price was so 100% above and beyond our every expectation. For Downtown Calgary the price and location you can't find that in any hotel. we can't wait to rebook cheers  and you guys were amazing🥰🥰 Thank you again Brian & Tanya",
      "We arrived a little early and the host was kind enough to let us drop our bags of before the flat was cleaned.  The cleaning girl was very precise, cheerful and kind.  The flat is bright lovely decor, compfy beds and well equipped with everything you could need including a wonderful selection of books to discover and enjoy.  We were very pleased with our stay.  Thank-you so much we will share your chic spot:)",
      "Absolutely loved this city rental! So tastefully decorated, very clean, incredible views, great location, and a good price. I would highly recommend and we would love to stay again!",
      "We had an amazing stay. It was clean, beautifully decorated, and had great restaurants near by. It was exactly as pictured/described. We will definitely stay here again next time we’re in Calgary",
      "It’s a nice cozy space with gorgeous views!! There is a small gym and tiny pool but the pool is open to the whole building. The space is clean with a good selection of books. The bed was okay. It gets super hot in the apt and there are no fans or AC. Someone also walked into the apt to fix a lock about 10 min after we checked in. Had they walked in 5 min later, the child they were with may have been traumatized. It’s a romantic space, ya know? Anyway, all in all it was good - but HOT!",
      "The host was incredibly responsive and super friendly, which made the stay even better! The views from the 30th floor were absolutely stunning. I had an amazing time with my friends and will definitely book again. The underground parking and 24-hour security were great additions. The only downside was that there was a bit too much furniture in the unit, so I had to rearrange a few things, but overall, everything was great. I highly recommend this place and will definitely return. Thank you!  :)",
      "The condo was beautiful and a great view of the city. We are from the country so we were pleased with everything. I got mixed up a bit with parking but I messaged our host and she responded asap. Our stay was amazing. Definitely recommend",

      "We had a wonderful stay! The space was clean, cute, and cozy - just like the photos showed. Anna was incredibly welcoming and accommodating, with thoughtful touches throughout, including some yummy little treats! The location was convenient and made getting around easy. We’d definitely stay here again!",
      "We loved the cozyness and warmth of the condo.  We would definitely stay again on a future trip.  Excellent location for Wordfest events.<br/>Anna is a top notch host, responsive and helpful.",
      "Anna was great to deal with, very friendly and responded very quickly. The place was really clean and looked just like the pictures. It was a nice walk to either downtown core or 17th Ave. Had a lovely stay.",
      "Well located for those requiring a place to stay downtown with 2 x bedrooms & kitchen. Street can be a little noisy at night, but that is natural for a downtown apartment in a big city.",
      "The location of the unit was GREAT, we walked to several restaurants, parks, playgrounds, etc. <br/>The building and unit are dated, but seemed safe. <br/>Check in was a little difficult, but after that initial time entering, it was super easy and convenient. <br/>Same with the garage/parking situation, only tricky at first. <br/>The host was quick and clear when communicating. <br/>It was worth the cost.<br/>Overall, I would recommend and stay at the unit again primarily because of location.",
      "Lovely condo in a great area! So close to Stephen Ave and the saddle dome. We we were able to walk to all of our destinations! <br/>Anna was easy to communicate with and check in was a breeze!",
      "We cannot recommend this apartment enough. Anna was very responsive to all our questions about the property and surrounding area. The location is great, easy access to everything in the city as well as getting to the C train for trips further out. The apartment was just what we needed for visiting relations, plenty of space for a family of 4. A great kitchen, spacious bedrooms and great views. Thanks Anna 😃",
      "Anna was an excellent host and her place was fantastic! Check in instructions were straightforward and easy to follow and her home felt very welcoming and clean. The beds were super cozy, especially when you’ve been outside exploring Calgary and beyond all day and there’s a lot of restaurants coffee shops bars and a nice little grocery store all within walking distance, definitely worth staying in her Airbnb, if you visit Calgary!",
      "A perfect home base, for my family of 4 (children ages 12 & 14), while in Calgary, for a baseball tournament. Comfortable and homey. Anna, was attentive and friendly. Would definitely stay here again!",
      "Fantastic stay during a challenging work trip. Perfect location with incredible food options within 1 block.  Restaurant market across the street has probably 15 delicious food options. Apartment was new, very clean and stocked with coffee, water, and snacks.  Beds were extremely comfortable. We had to extend 1 day due to work and Anna was extremely responsive.  Will try to stay with Anna in this neighborhood next time I'm in Calgary. Thanks Anna!!!",
      "Great place - second bedroom doesn’t have a window although there is a lot  natural light in the rest of the apartment.  Immaculate presentation and we enjoyed our short stay.",

The apartment is a very cute space located in downtown, perfect for stay for a single person or a couple. <br/>Anna is a wonderful host and promptly responded to all my messages. I’m definitely sharing this listing with other friends who will be travelling to Calgary.",
      "Wonderful location, especially for going to an event at the Saddledome-just a 15 minute walk, albeit extremely cold, but that’s winter in Calgary! Good restaurant and grocery options nearby and the unit was great-so nicely set up. Anna was so helpful, especially in quickly resolving a TV issue when the prior visitor logged out of the unit’s Roku account. Would love to stay here again!",

The space was clean, comfortable, and worked perfectly for our group of five. Chloe and Jason were responsive and welcoming. We’d happily come back!",
      "The place was amazing, great location and a modern building. Check in was easy and access to the building and parking was simple and a breeze. Great space with all the amenities required during our stay. Chloe and Jason are great hosts, very accommodating and quick to respond to any questions or issues during our stay.",
      "Really easy checkin process and the building was very safe. There were several homeless drugged out people hanging around the building but we felt very secure inside. <br/>The space was clean and tidy. Lots of amenities! We were traveling with a 4 month baby and it was the perfect setup with two rooms and two bathrooms. One thing would have been nice would be to have real doors instead of sliding doors for the baby.<br/>The kitchen was great for our bottle washing setup and having a full fridge. <br/>Would definitely stay again",
      "Beautiful place with a well laid out guide to the place and surrounding area. Building is in a great location with a friendly front desk. My only complaint is Jason and Chloe became unresponsive after check-out with an item we left at their place.",

There were several homeless drugged out people hanging around the building but we felt very secure inside. <br/>The space was clean and tidy. Lots of amenities! We were traveling with a 4 month baby and it was the perfect setup with two rooms and two bathrooms. One thing would have been nice would be to have real doors instead of sliding doors for the baby.<br/>The kitchen was great for our bottle washing setup and having a full fridge. <br/>Would definitely stay again",

      "We have used Airbnb for several years and have even been Airbnb hosts for some of those years.  This listing was the best by far.  Beautiful, clean, we had everything we needed to feel comfortable, walkable, and great view of Calgary.  Need I go on?  So many more reasons to love this place.  Do not miss an opportunity to stay here if you are in Calgary.",
      "We had a fantastic stay at Teressa's Airbnb.  The place was very clean & comfortable. Decorated just lovley. Everything to make our stay feel like home. Location was also perfect to be able to walk to many landmarks & the many yummy food establishments. Would highly recommend this place & would absolutely go back again. Thank you from, MJ & Denine",
      "Couldn't fault this place at all! Teresa was absolutely fantastic and quick to reply to any queries. The view was stunning and the beds sooo comfortable. We will 100% be back. <br/>Thank you so much guys!",
      "I give this stay a 10 out of 10! The hose was super communicative and friendly. She allowed us to check in earlier and was very flexible. The space was super clean and she had everything you could possibly need as far as toiletries an iron, a blow dryer… you name it! The views from the stay are spectacular. You can see the Calgary Tower and it’s amazing. It’s also really close by many local restaurants which make it easy to sightsee.  I really enjoyed the place and hope to be back again soon!",
      "The place has an incredible view of the city center and is located right on an avenue full of dining options. The host responded quickly and left very clear instructions and some recommendations. The apartment is exactly as described and very comfortable. The area is quiet during the day, but at night I wouldn't recommend straying too far as there are many homeless people and it makes you feel unsafe. Other than that, everything is great to stay here!",
      "Great apartment in the heart of Calgary with close access to stores, coffee and food. The apartment was as described, very clean and comfortable. The views of the city and Calgary tower at night are amazing. We’d definitely stay here again on our next visit. Thanks again",

      "Teresa’s place was spotless and incredibly well-maintained. You can tell she takes great pride in keeping everything clean and organized.

Highly recommend for anyone who values cleanliness and a peaceful environment!",
      "Staying in Calgary? Teresas place is very clean and comfortable. Beds are super comfy, views are great, and the access to the building is simple. Highly recommend staying here. <br/>13th Ave is a always a great spot to stay and this place is exceptionally located to all the fun stuff. It's close to the Beltliner for a classic diner breakfast. Coffee is North across the street at Starbucks or West at the Market. You also have proof which is a great cocktail bar. A hop and a skip away from Leopolds Tavern for a later night burg. Great place to stay if you are attending a concert at the Saddledome or Expo at the BMO Centre.",

From its 11th-floor windows, we enjoyed excellent views of the downtown skyline and the lively bustle below—a perfect blend of comfort and city energy.

Coffee is North across the street at Starbucks or West at the Market. You also have proof which is a great cocktail bar. A hop and a skip away from Leopolds Tavern for a later night burg. Great place to stay if you are attending a concert at the Saddledome or Expo at the BMO Centre.",

      "Alizeh was a great hostess!!! Very responsive with communication and so patient with me as I had a hard time with the door code. The place was beautifully decorated. Appreciated the coffee, creamer and sugar. Bed was super comfortable! Great location with lots to do; terrific restaurants and coffee shops.",
      "Alizeh’s unit was the perfect size for a couple and 1 or 2 children.  The location is right in the downtown with restaurants and bars, entertainment, and nice areas to walk by the river.  There’s a fantastic view from the 12th floor with floor to ceiling windows.   Visiting Calgary was made all the better by this lodging’s location.  We highly recommend Alizeh’s AirBnB.",

The location was incredibly convenient.<br/>A few notes if folks are staying on the couch: <br/>- Bring an eye mask (the blinds are very thin).<br/>- The bedroom has a sliding door and an opening to the kitchen near the ceiling, so bring ear plugs.<br/>- You have to go through the bedroom to get to the bathroom. <br/>- But the pull out couch is pretty big and comfy!",

      "Great place overall. The kitchen is better equipped than lots of airbnbs in some ways, and yet was missing some key items if you want to cook full meals from scratch (no chef's knife, bread knife, grater, or vegetable peeler, and the non-stick frypan is too scraped up to use safely, coffee was supplied but no tea). In every other way, the apartment felt generously welcoming and comfortable.",
      "Beautifully clean condo in a fun location, close to a variety of restaurants and in a vibrant area.  Gorgeous view of downtown.  Had a great stay.  Only caution is the parkade is a bit tight and it would be challenging to maneuver a large vehicle (e.g a truck).  But that said, it's very nice to have heated and secure parking.",
      "Najam and his co-hosts were amazing. Super quick and easy to communicate with from start to finish, which made everything very smooth. The place has an incredible view and is in such a convenient spot downtown. The underground parking was a great bonus, especially in winter. I’d definitely recommend staying here!",
      "What a WONDERFUL spot!!!<br/>Spotless, organized and an easy walk anywhere….we loved our time here and will definitely be back to enjoy it all over again:)",
      "Was a great place, mum and me were on a little getaway highly recommend if<br/>your wanting a great place in downtown.",
      "Clean, great location and all details communicated clearly. I would stay again!",
      "Great host, responsiveness was swift, easy check in and out!",
      "Excellent location in downtown Calgary. Really nice condo with a great view!",
      "Nice apartment with good location for our family attending Calgary Stampede for the 1st time.",
      "This place was very clean with a beautiful view of downtown Calgary . The check in and out was very easy and Najam is helpful if you have any questions. I would recommend this bnb !!",
      "I had a wonderful stay at this Airbnb! The place was spotless, cozy, and exactly as described. The host was very responsive and helpful throughout my visit. The location was perfect, close to everything I needed. I especially loved the little touches like the welcome snacks and local tips. The bed was super comfortable, and I felt right at home. Check-in and check-out were smooth and hassle-free. Overall, it was a great experience, and I’d definitely recommend it to anyone visiting the area. I would happily stay here again!",
      "Great place to stay in Calgary! If you like being downtown, this is the spot. I’d recommend this place to friends and family, for sure. Will definitely stay here again in the future!",
      "We had a lovely stay. The check-in and check-out was seamless with good communication prior. The unit has a nice view, layout, and good kitchen and laundry machine.  My little one's travel crib fit in the smaller room with the closet doors open and made for a dark room for naps and he loved the view from the couch. Overall the value is good too as it's a several minute walk from the Telus Centre and much more affordable than staying at a conference hotel which doesn't even include parking. I'd happily stay there again I need to!",
      "Really great spot, looks a hidden gem from the outside. <br/>Awesome location to walk to downtown and easy for 17th Avenue. <br/>Great bars and restaurants on the doorstep.<br/>The view of the Calgary skyline was stunning. Would definitely stay again",
      "Our stay was great. The place was incredibly clean, including all linens. The beds were very comfortable. It is a smaller condo, and may be tight for 4 people for an extended period, but it was very comfortable for 2 people. The host was very communicative and quick to respond. The check in instructions and details for our stay were crystal clear and easy to follow. We did have one issue when checking in, however the host was very quick to respond and fix the issue. The building is a little tired, but the apartment was totally fine and updated. We would stay here again."

Only caution is the parkade is a bit tight and it would be challenging to maneuver a large vehicle (e.g a truck).  But that said, it's very nice to have heated and secure parking.",

      "Great location, clean and well stocked apartment. Literally the only negative was a broken soap dispenser and the pullout bed is uncomfortable, but overall a great place to stay.",
      "As far as Airbnb hosts go, Samantha and zahid were phenomenal and exceeded expectations. They were incredibly quick to respond, helpful, and very pleasant to interact with. The place was exactly as described and was easy to find. There were instructions for everything we needed during our stay. Would highly recommend staying at their Airbnb!",
      "Samantha and Zahid’s place was nice and clean. It was very close to lots of places to eat. I love how responsive there were and they provided clear instructions from check-in to checking out. The view was a great bonus, and they always let me know of any information pertaining to the building in a timely manner. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone visiting Calgary.",
      "The place was very comfortable. Everything we needed was there plus more. Value for money highly recommended.we enjoyed our stay",
      "Amazing accommodation, felt right at home and very central. Easy to find and great amenities!",
      "It was good wish faced the city but I forgot to ask dish washer smell gross could use a better cleaning in bedroom bathroom walls the outside of fridge and stove could have been cleaner and wasn't the best sleep as someone pulled a fire alarm but it was a very nice place felt at home and great hosts also daughter named the plant in the bedroom its name Thelma",
      "Had a great time, nothing negative to say as I enjoyed the room, had a good view of the city, the room was clean, and the hosts were kind.",
      "Perfect place to stay for a couples of nights. Excellent location, clean and comfy apt.",
      "A good location in Calgary for a reasonable price.",
      "Very conveniently located and clean space! A couple things were left to be desired (one single trash can, broken soap dispenser, surprise that second room had sliding not standard door), but these are small and not at all a big deal. The off-Airbnb extra app for check in instructions, including a surprise need to detour to pick up the keys from a corner mart 10 minutes away, was clunky and kind of annoying but ultimately easy enough to navigate (only accessible within a short window pre-check in, which made it difficult to plan ahead for this). Check out fortunately <br/>was easy! This apartment did just the job for a one night pre-airport stay with my boyfriend and mom, but I may not have chosen to stay longer. This would be a great place for a small bachelor(ette) trip or the like!",
      "liked everything about the apartment.",
      "Overall good stay, bedsheets and towels were not clean",
      "Good spot and good place to stay",
      "The dish washer was broken, and a limited supply of dish soap. You have to be careful if you parking in this building. Firstly, the parking instructions were not clear. You get into the parking area, and they will tell you the parking spot after you pay ($20/day). Better they charge along with booking. There was a limit supply of garbage bags. When I contacted the owners, they said there is no one available. The unit filled up with the cigarette smell the moment we turn off the AC.",
      "We had a great time, the place was amazing with a beautiful view. It’s near everything you need from pubs to restaurants and even parks.. will definitely stay here again.",
      "This was a lovely place to come for a getaway. The apartment was beautiful, clean, very well thought out and well designed. A lot of time and effort has been put into it, which we appreciated. The hosts were very kind and excellent at communicating with us. The area was great to see, and to find places to eat. The only downside was that we had felt some standard kitchen items were missing - basic  condiments and cooking supplies, tea, scrubber for dishes, foil, plastic bags, and more basic baking pans. <br/>Overall a wonderful stay and would highly recommend.",
      "Had a great stay.  Hosts were attentive and the condo is exactly as the pictures detail. I'd highly recommend this place and would book here again the next time I'm in town.",
      "Great place",
      "It was perfect",
      "Great location",
      "Only stayed for a night but a very good night it was nice and welcoming place with a great view would recommend",
      "Great location, clean, modern space. would definitely stay here again, and hoping to in the future",
      "Pros:<br/>Perfection location, right in the middle of great food and bars.<br/>Clean, newer building. Excellent view.<br/>Parking stall was good, fit our SUV no problem. <br/>Cons:<br/>The property seems to be managed by a property manager without direct knowledge of the unit, which led to incorrect info. I had specifically asked whether the bedrooms had standard doors (for more privacy) instead of a sliding glass door, as the listing photos did not show doors but another listing in the same building had a glass sliding door. The property manager checked, then replied \"rest assured each room is equipped with standard doors\", so I booked this unit over the other listing despite this unit being more expensive and with worse check-in/out times. Unfortunately, once we stepped into the unit, we saw that it was indeed the sliding glass door. I informed the property manager about this and they did apologize and say they had mistaken it with another unit but nothing further was done.<br/>Overall still a good unit.",
      "The place is well organized and steps away from restaurants and shops. The location is great for a weekend away in Calgary!"

Check out fortunately <br/>was easy! This apartment did just the job for a one night pre-airport stay with my boyfriend and mom, but I may not have chosen to stay longer.

You get into the parking area, and they will tell you the parking spot after you pay ($20/day). Better they charge along with booking. There was a limit supply of garbage bags. When I contacted the owners, they said there is no one available. The unit filled up with the cigarette smell the moment we turn off the AC.",

A lot of time and effort has been put into it, which we appreciated. The hosts were very kind and excellent at communicating with us. The area was great to see, and to find places to eat. The only downside was that we had felt some standard kitchen items were missing - basic  condiments and cooking supplies, tea, scrubber for dishes, foil, plastic bags, and more basic baking pans. <br/>Overall a wonderful stay and would highly recommend.",

We're glad to hear that you found our communication to be excellent. We appreciate your feedback regarding the kitchen items. We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused. We believe that there are basic condiments and cooking supplies provided on the property. I'll make sure to have this clarified with our guests in the future. Thank you for recommending our place, and we hope to have the opportunity to host you again in the future."

Excellent view.<br/>Parking stall was good, fit our SUV no problem. <br/>Cons:<br/>The property seems to be managed by a property manager without direct knowledge of the unit, which led to incorrect info. I had specifically asked whether the bedrooms had standard doors (for more privacy) instead of a sliding glass door, as the listing photos did not show doors but another listing in the same building had a glass sliding door. The property manager checked, then replied \"rest assured each room is equipped with standard doors\", so I booked this unit over the other listing despite this unit being more expensive and with worse check-in/out times. Unfortunately, once we stepped into the unit, we saw that it was indeed the sliding glass door. I informed the property manager about this and they did apologize and say they had mistaken it with another unit but nothing further was done.<br/>Overall still a good unit.",

Well equipped and comfortable - was just right for our needs. <br/>If you are light sensitive, bring an eye mask as one of the bedrooms looks out over the city - quite light in the mornings. Other bedroom at the back.  <br/>Very good communication and responsiveness - thanks Beth!<br/>Ian",

This open floor plan makes it easy to cook, eat, relax, entertain and feel connected to the people you're traveling with. In the living room, you're able to log into your own accounts using the smart TV and will find cuddling up on the couch quite comfortable. The couch can be used as an additional sleeping space, and it folds out into a sofa bed, should you wish to travel in a larger group. In the bathroom, you'll find towels, shampoo/conditioner, soap, a hair dryer, and a combo bath/shower. The primary bedroom offers a queen-sized bed, lamp, shelf, and closet. It also boasts large windows which brighten up the space.  The sliding fogged doors can be closed or completely opened up to allow you to watch TV from bed.  The second bedroom offers a double bed for comfortable sleep.The space is great for those traveling or anyone living in Calgary and looking for a date night. Instead of rushing home and having to come back downtown, pack a bag and get ready in the suite. You'll be able to walk to popular favorites such as 10 Foot Henry (1 min walk), The Allium (2 min walk), Native Tongues Taqueria (3 min walk), Two Penny (1 min walk) or the Saddledome (13 min walk).  The best part?! You'll be able to skip the pricey cab ride and sleep in the next morning! Leaving you feeling refreshed. Use that extra time (and energy) to hit a fitness class (Hot Shop Yoga is just across the street!) or head to brunch to catch up with a friend."

      "Easy checkin<br/>Convenient location<br/>Safeway 400m<br/>Secure building with gym and parking <br/>Apartment is bright and airy.<br/>Nicely decorated <br/>Comfortable beds<br/>Kitchen well equipped <br/>Enjoyable stay!!",
      "This place was in a great location, was as in the pictures, beds were comfortable and check in/out instructions were great. The only downfall was that the place was not clean and a note to the hosts regarding this was not answered. I spent some time cleaning on arrival but there was no mops etc for me to clean the floors. Windows had handprints all over them, crumbs on tables, floors were dirty, dusting hadn’t been done in some time and oven was unusable due to amount of burnt food/grease stains inside. Would have been a 5/5 if clean.",
      "We loved our stay. I particularly enjoyed looking out at the beautiful city lights and looking at all the beautiful buildings. We were close to everything Safeway Starbucks every kind of restaurant you can think of in a movie theater. Our house even let us use their parking spot in a double gated parking garage with security doors, even into the building. We never felt unsafe. Sitting on the balcony was relaxing and really enhanced our Calgary experience. I would come back here in a heartbeat.",
      "Wonderful stay! The place was spotless, stylish, and very comfortable- exactly as shown in the photos. The host was responsive, and made everything super easy. Great location too. View from balcony was spectacular! Highly recommend 👍",
      "This place was clean and conveniently located for my trip to Calgary. It is in the heart of downtown and near train tracks so it is noisy at all times of day, but was to be expected for the location. The balcony was particularly nice with panoramic city views.",
      "Host were gracious and accommodating. Responsive <br/>It's in a great location. The building is close to amenities <br/>Nothing you can do but that side of the building is a bit noisy. With doors closed all fine but can't really enjoy the great balcony and sunset view <br/>It's a good not and accommodated 2  couples. Good size unit. <br/>Not a 5 star clean however the hosts were responsive <br/>Overall, it is a good spot for a short stay",
      "This flat was in a great location - walkable to all the downtown areas. Great coffee shops and restaurants nearby. Great views of downtown and the Calgary tower from the flat. It was pretty quiet inside even though the trains came through downtown during the night. The hosts were fantastic with great instructions, communication and fast responses. Highly recommend.",
      "Our super late check in was no issue had multiple units with a group in building. Parkade was big enough for a full size wagoneer no issue. (Even though we parked in wrong spot building was helpful and understanding everyone friendly front to back.",
      "I had a wonderful 4-day stay at this Calgary apartment. From the moment I arrived, it felt welcoming and comfortable, providing the perfect balance of convenience and tranquility. With the doors closed, the space was incredibly quiet, allowing for restful nights and relaxing downtime. While the nearby train could be heard when the windows or balcony doors were open, it was never intrusive and didn’t affect my stay. The kitchen was a standout feature—fully equipped with everything I needed, from utensils and cookware to plates and glasses. The balcony was a lovely bonus, perfect for morning coffee or evening relaxation, adding a touch of outdoor enjoyment. The host was responsive and accommodating, providing clear instructions and ensuring a smooth check-in & check-out process.  I would highly recommend this property to anyone visiting Calgary and would happily return on future trips.",
      "We had a wonderful stay at Misbah and Zubi’s place. The view was amazing and felt secure even though it’s located downtown. The place itself was really great with enough space for 4-6 guests at a time. Fully functional kitchen plus air conditioning. Both beds are comfortable plus they have extra blankets (and towels) for the hide-in bed in the living room. Other than that, the place is accurately described in the listing. <br/>Misbah and Zubi are both responsive and helpful in accommodating our requests when I reached out. I brought up the issue that some of the knives are rusty and they said they will be replacing them soon.<br/>They also provided detailed information on getting to the place and in locating the parkade underground. <br/>Highly recommend this AirBnb to anyone looking for a great place to stay. I would love to book this place again in the future!",
      "Amazing Airbnb! One of the best I’ve stayed in by far. The location was amazing downtown and walkable to everything I needed to do for my trip. Secure and safe parking was a bonus. The unit was clean, had everything I needed and the most comfortable bed!! Very quiet and couldn’t even hear anything outside. Host was very responsive and accommodating to my plans and schedule. So worth the price and would definitely stay again.",
      "Nice place to stay. Convenient for us to go somewhere. Feel safe and securities are friendly! Wish we could stay longer!",
      "Amazing location in downtown. Very close to lots of bars and clubs, the Airbnb was beautiful, modern and clean.  Would definitely recommend!",

The only downfall was that the place was not clean and a note to the hosts regarding this was not answered. I spent some time cleaning on arrival but there was no mops etc for me to clean the floors. Windows had handprints all over them, crumbs on tables, floors were dirty, dusting hadn’t been done in some time and oven was unusable due to amount of burnt food/grease stains inside. Would have been a 5/5 if clean.",

Sitting on the balcony was relaxing and really enhanced our Calgary experience. I would come back here in a heartbeat.",

With the doors closed, the space was incredibly quiet, allowing for restful nights and relaxing downtime. While the nearby train could be heard when the windows or balcony doors were open, it was never intrusive and didn’t affect my stay. The kitchen was a standout feature—fully equipped with everything I needed, from utensils and cookware to plates and glasses. The balcony was a lovely bonus, perfect for morning coffee or evening relaxation, adding a touch of outdoor enjoyment. The host was responsive and accommodating, providing clear instructions and ensuring a smooth check-in & check-out process.  I would highly recommend this property to anyone visiting Calgary and would happily return on future trips.",

The place itself was really great with enough space for 4-6 guests at a time. Fully functional kitchen plus air conditioning. Both beds are comfortable plus they have extra blankets (and towels) for the hide-in bed in the living room. Other than that, the place is accurately described in the listing. <br/>Misbah and Zubi are both responsive and helpful in accommodating our requests when I reached out. I brought up the issue that some of the knives are rusty and they said they will be replacing them soon.<br/>They also provided detailed information on getting to the place and in locating the parkade underground. <br/>Highly recommend this AirBnb to anyone looking for a great place to stay. I would love to book this place again in the future!",

      "I enjoyed my stay here. Clean linens and equipment. <br/>Excellent and clear directives. <br/>The building is in quite a strategic location which enables you have an excellent view of downtown. <br/>It’s smaller than I expected but overall it’s cozy. <br/>I look forward to spending time here if have to visit Calgary again",
      "We absolutely loved staying in this apartment.  We had everything we needed, the apartment itself was immaculate and in a great location.  We loved the views of the city and sitting out on the balcony. We probably spent more time in the apartment than we usually would just because we loved being in there so much. Everything went very smoothly and we wouldn’t hesitate to stay there again.",
      "I had a wonderful stay at this beautiful home! It was spotless, comfortable, and had everything I needed for my visit. Kyle & Andrew were amazing hosts. friendly, responsive, and thoughtful throughout my stay. The location was great and made my time in Calgary even better. Everything was perfect, and I would definitely stay here again. Highly recommend this beautiful home!",
      "Our stay was absolutely excellent! Communication with the hosts was very quick and clear from the start — the check-in and check-out instructions were easy to follow. One time, we accidentally left one of our keys inside the apartment, and they responded immediately, helping us right away. We also forgot an item at check-out, and they kindly returned it to us in perfect condition with no extra charge. Everything was handled so well! Highly recommend this place.",
      "My second stay in Calgary. This apartment was better than the previous I had.  It is situated far better in a more cozy area compared to SE Calgary.   Would rent this place again.",
      "This is the second time staying at this location, very walkable and accesible, central to many restaurants. It was a bit noisy due to the stampede tent but that will not be a problem until next year. The hosts are great and understanding even after I lost the key-fobs, obviously I needed to pay the replacements. I like the alternative option of calling someone to give access to the condo. I have not seen that anywhere else.",
      "Great location, close to both downtown and beltline. Lots of nice cafes and restaurants. Smooth checkin, hosts are very responsive. <br/>The couch is not comfortable  and there are no blackout blinds so it is bright at night. Recommend carrying eye marks",
      "very convenient place to stay.  everything was walking distance and made our stay less stressful. beautiful views",
      "I would definitely recommend this air bnb to anyone. I felt so at home, they had extra things I didn’t even think to pack. The air bnb was just beautiful. When I had to leave they were really good with letting me know what I could do to help out (where to bring garbage/recycle etc). I will definitely book with them again if and when I travel back to Calgary.",
      "Kyle did a great job providing all the instructions before, during and after my stays. Great place! I enjoyed my time at Kyle’s place.",
      "Enjoyed my stay there. Would love to come back. The apartment has beautiful interior and view. It’s super clean and cozy.",
      "The location was fantastic—perfect for exploring downtown Calgary, with plenty of great restaurants nearby. The hosts were also very responsive, which we appreciated. However, the listing was a bit misleading—the space felt smaller than in the photos, and there was no mountain view as advertised. The main downside was the comfort, as the bedding (mattress and pillows) felt a bit worn out, and the couch wasn’t very usable. Overall, it was okay for a short stay, but not the best option for those looking for a truly comfortable experience.",
      "I had a fantastic stay at this Airbnb! The place was impeccably clean, spacious, and cozy, with a perfect layout that made it feel like a home away from home. The host was very responsive. Definitely returning!!",
      "I really recommend staying at one of Kyle & Andrew’s properties. The place was absolutely beautiful with city views and so close to many restaurants, bars, grocery stores, and shopping. It was the perfect place for a weekend getaway!  Kyle and Andrew are very responsive to your messages and make the check in instructions clear and easy. They messaged me daily to make sure our accommodation was meeting our expectations which I really appreciated! Plus the underground parking was so nice to have for our stay! I will definitely be staying at one of their accommodations again in the future!",
      "Kyle was great, definitely recommend anyone visiting the area",
      "The apartment was just as pictures, easy to get around, and the parking was handy. Nice balcony and seating.<br/>The hosts can't do anything about it, but there were quite a few homeless in the alleys around the apartment block, in general there are a lot of homeless in the city though.  Nice touches like bssic supplies and coffee pods<br/>The hosts were very keen to make sure everything was great, with frequent communications and clear instructions.<br/>As other guests have mentioned, the couch is not comfortable and could probably benefit from being replaced.  The other thing that would make the place even better would be some blackout blinds or curtains in the bedroom  as it was very light and this disturbed our sleep.",
      "Great unit exactly what you see in the photos!",
      "Very cozy and very reassuring that the hosts checked in via chat often.",
      "It was great place. Lots of restaurants and things to do, all within walking distance. It’s a great place to stay in Calgary.",
      "Beautiful place with a great view. Loved the design. Great to have parking included. Enjoyed it very much.",
      "Great place right downtown. They have a coffee machine and tea which was really nice. The building has a small gym which is very convenient.",
      "Great apartment! <br/>Ultra clean, super well equipped, very well decorated.<br/>If you're looking for a city apartment experience, this is perfect!<br/>Kyle was very proactive and very quick to answer our questions. <br/>Totally recommend!",
      "Good place to stay, nice review and accomodating hosts🙌🏻",
      "Great stay, clean and the hosts were responsive, will be staying here again :)"

We loved the views of the city and sitting out on the balcony. We probably spent more time in the apartment than we usually would just because we loved being in there so much. Everything went very smoothly and we wouldn’t hesitate to stay there again.",

It was a bit noisy due to the stampede tent but that will not be a problem until next year.

However, the listing was a bit misleading—the space felt smaller than in the photos, and there was no mountain view as advertised. The main downside was the comfort, as the bedding (mattress and pillows) felt a bit worn out, and the couch wasn’t very usable. Overall, it was okay for a short stay, but not the best option for those looking for a truly comfortable experience.",

Nice touches like bssic supplies and coffee pods<br/>The hosts were very keen to make sure everything was great, with frequent communications and clear instructions.<br/>As other guests have mentioned, the couch is not comfortable and could probably benefit from being replaced.  The other thing that would make the place even better would be some blackout blinds or curtains in the bedroom  as it was very light and this disturbed our sleep.",

Everything was as advertised, and comes with a great view of downtown Calgary. We don't visit the city too often, but when we do, we'll be looking out for your listings. Would reccomend! <br/>-Paul",

      "Fantastic place to stay in downtown core with beautiful views",
      "Well… I stayed for 1 week on this apartment. The apartment was dirty and dusty. It has a great view of downtown, but it is not worthy the price I paid. <br/>I had some trouble to park the car, since there was no instruction saying the parking spot number. <br/>The responsible person took some  time to answer and I had to stay inside of the car until I figure out what was the parking number. After 12 hours car trip(I was really tired).  He was very rude at first, saying I didn’t read the manual with the informations, which I did and later he confessed there was a “bug” in the system and didn’t show me the full information about parking. <br/>Note: if you have children, be careful because the bedroom doors have very sharp metal edges and can hurt a kid very easily and get your clothing stuck when you’re walking by. <br/>Other than that.. the apartment is well located. Garage gate keys need to be replaced. Not working very well. <br/>Peaceful place.",
      "I was in the city attending a wedding. Location was perfect. Everything you need is on your doorstep or a short walk away.<br/>Apartment was on the 19th floor offering AMAZING views over the city.<br/>Any issues and concerns I had were answered and sorted straight away. Great support.",

        "review": "Well… I stayed for 1 week on this apartment. The apartment was dirty and dusty. It has a great view of downtown, but it is not worthy the price I paid. <br/>I had some trouble to park the car, since there was no instruction saying the parking spot number. <br/>The responsible person took some  time to answer and I had to stay inside of the car until I figure out what was the parking number. After 12 hours car trip(I was really tired).  He was very rude at first, saying I didn’t read the manual with the informations, which I did and later he confessed there was a “bug” in the system and didn’t show me the full information about parking. <br/>Note: if you have children, be careful because the bedroom doors have very sharp metal edges and can hurt a kid very easily and get your clothing stuck when you’re walking by. <br/>Other than that.. the apartment is well located. Garage gate keys need to be replaced. Not working very well. <br/>Peaceful place.",
        "host_response": "When Jonathan mentioned the unit was dusty, we immediately offered to send a cleaner out to resolve the issue — an offer that was declined — and there were no further concerns raised after that point.<br/>Regarding the garage fob and the metal edges on the doors: unfortunately, we were not made aware of these issues during Jonathans' stay. Had we been informed, we would have addressed them right away. We're always more than willing to resolve problems promptly when given the opportunity to do so, and we truly value open communication with our guests."

      "Very well located near 17ave, great value for money. Place was exactly as advertised. A bit older but functional. Murray was responsive if anything was missing .<br/>Supplies (kitchen , bathroom) are bare minimum, just enough for 4 people, might wanna ask for extra.",
      "Great stay- perfect location for stampede",
      "Good!",
      "It was an amazing stay ! It is 2 blocks away from red mile that has a variety of options. Restaurants and cute shops . Murray is an amazing host ! I saw him painting the fence while we were there , he was pleasant and friendly . The place is beautiful! 🤩 the doors are glass and super cool ! I will be back , thanks again Murray . See you soon",
      "This is a fantastic apartment! It's stylish, comfortable and in an absolutely amazing location. Almost every possible amenity is within walking distance and the dining options are out of this world. Tacos... Shawarma... Burgers... Hot sandwiches... Sushi... Bubble tea... Trendy coffee spots... it's got everything near by.",
      "Murray was an amazing host, so responsive on any issues or questions we had and the place was perfect for getting us started in Calgary. A minutes walk from 17th with loads of bars and restaurants but also very quiet in the apartment. Would recommend this apartment and Murray to anyone for their stay in Calgary!",
      "Murray’s place was a great location and he was a communicative host when we had issues with the shower and a mixup with check-in communications. Would recommend staying for a peaceful place but the unit could use some better blinds for the bedrooms for light control in the future.",
      "Stayed a week.  Place is exactly as described.  Murray was very helpful and responsive.<br/>Location is excellent.  Lots to do with restaurants and groceries close at hand.<br/>Will stay here again when we return to Calgary.",
      "This was a great Air BNB. 5 stars all around. Very comfortable and spacious apartment, in a very central location. Check in was easy and straightforward. I would happily stay here again in the future.",
      "Thank you.",
      "Great location and great unit! Absolutely loved it. Murray was super responsive and helpful with everything. Definitely would stay here again.",
      "Great property, very easily accessible.",
      "Is a great quiet location. Beautiful tree lined street. Close to 4th street businesses and restaurants. Walkable to 17th and Stephen ave. Suite was clean and bed was comfy. Was nice to have the balcony to sit out on and have a coffee. Had a great stay.",
      "I had doubts at first cos I saw poor ratings on Google, but I was pleasantly surprised! <br/>I booked a month stay with a friend and arrived during winter. The place is simple, modern and elegant! The beds, were sooo comfortable. The appartment had everything we needed to get by comfortably for a month (pots, pans, small appliances, baking utensils etc.). We just had to buy groceries. The location was also great! It was walking distance from pretty much everything (restaurants, grocery stores, Dollarama, city center, bus stops, etc.) but far away from noise and chaos. <br/>Murray was really kind and helpful. When the weather was really bad he checked in regularly to make sure everything was okay. <br/>To summarize, it was home away from home and the perfect place to stay till we got our appartment.<br/>I would recommend this place in a heartbeat especially for longer stays.",
      "This spot is great price for a great location! Nice and cozy in the winter.",
      "Great location! Clean and nice.",
      "Great location next to 17ave, very clean."

The place is simple, modern and elegant! The beds, were sooo comfortable. The appartment had everything we needed to get by comfortably for a month (pots, pans, small appliances, baking utensils etc.). We just had to buy groceries. The location was also great! It was walking distance from pretty much everything (restaurants, grocery stores, Dollarama, city center, bus stops, etc.) but far away from noise and chaos. <br/>Murray was really kind and helpful. When the weather was really bad he checked in regularly to make sure everything was okay. <br/>To summarize, it was home away from home and the perfect place to stay till we got our appartment.<br/>I would recommend this place in a heartbeat especially for longer stays.",

      "We really enjoyed our stay at Kyle’s place. Host was responsive and very communicative.  Place was clean and location was excellent. Great view of the city from the patio.  You can hear freight  trains go by frequently with the patio door open, but the noise didn’t enter the house when we closed the door at night. We would definitely stay here again.",
      "The property was nice and comfortable. Its central location made it easy to access restaurants and meeting spaces. Although situated downtown, the apartment building is in a peaceful area, away from traffic and closer to green spaces.<br/>Kyle and Andrew were wonderful hosts; they were very responsive and proactive with all the necessary information for the stay. Thanks for making our stay comfortable.",
      "I had a great stay at Kyle and Andrew’s modern condo! The space was clean, cozy, and well-appointed with everything I needed for a comfortable visit. The location is perfect, close to many restaurants, bars, must-see. I’d highly recommend this condo for anyone looking for a modern and centrally-located place to stay!",
      "Good place — would definitely recommend! The space was clean, comfortable, and exactly as described. The host was friendly and made check-in super easy.",
      "Excellent and easy communication. Nice place for a short dtay",
      "Great place for short stays! Kyle & Andrew were easy to communicate with and timely with all requests. Highly recommend to others visiting downtown Calgary!",
      "Easy to get to down town, close to 17ave.<br/>Great condo, I would stay again.<br/>You can hear the train, it goes by frequently, didn’t bother me much but ear plugs at night might be good if you sleep light. I was here a week and loved my stay.",
      "A clean space in downtown Calgary, with great shops and restaurants within walking distance.<br/>I was surprised how quiet it was! <br/>Hosts were proactive and quick to respond!",
      "We stayed for several months at this location. Great service, fast response times and very willing to refill any items we might have used up during the long stay. Place was very clean when we arrived except for dust in the ceiling vents and carpet, but otherwise very well maintained. <br/>This spot is located next to a bottle depot so expect some people lingering around the area, but the building's security is top notch so there's no need to worry. The ctrain and +15 are both less than 15 minutes away, very convenient.<br/>We were promised some sort of discount upon booking this location for the second time but we never received said discount, so just keep that in mind if you're doing the same and expecting the same deal.<br/>Overall, very good spot if you're looking to stay for an extended period of time!",
      "Great place, the house as everything you need and then some. Great hosts, very responsive.",
      "Kyle and Andrew's apartment was a fantastic stay! perfect walking distance to downtown and 17th Ave, we were able to really enjoy our time in the core of Calgary. The included garage parking spot is a bonus! The view from the balcony at night was just the cherry on top! <br/>Amenities in the apartment were great, the gas stove is a cooks dream! <br/>Would definitely stay here again next time I'm in Calgary!",
      "The place was amazing right in the downtown. It has all the amenities that one could ask for. Very clean apartment and the best part was that Host was very quick in responding to the queries. I would love to stay here again.",
      "I recently had the pleasure of staying at Kyle and Andrew's Airbnb. It was an absolutely fantastic experience. From the moment I arrived, I felt welcomed and at home. The property was exactly as described, if not better. It was clean and equipped with all the amenities one could need.<br/>The location was perfect, situated in the west end of downtown Calgary, close to a grocery store.<br/>Kyle and Andrew are  exceptional hosts.

You can hear freight  trains go by frequently with the patio door open, but the noise didn’t enter the house when we closed the door at night. We would definitely stay here again.",

Place was very clean when we arrived except for dust in the ceiling vents and carpet, but otherwise very well maintained. <br/>This spot is located next to a bottle depot so expect some people lingering around the area, but the building's security is top notch so there's no need to worry. The ctrain and +15 are both less than 15 minutes away, very convenient.<br/>We were promised some sort of discount upon booking this location for the second time but we never received said discount, so just keep that in mind if you're doing the same and expecting the same deal.<br/>Overall, very good spot if you're looking to stay for an extended period of time!",

      "The unit is perfectly clean and stylish. The host is very caring to provide us with tea and coffee. The kitchen is well-equipped with classy cooking utensils. It was easy for us to transform the couch into a comfy bed. The location is brilliant and has a vibrant community. The instructions to the garage room could be clearer.",
      "We were a group of five and really enjoyed our stay. The apartment was clean, comfortable, and in a great location. It has two bedrooms: one is pretty big, while the other is smaller and windowless. It matches the photos, but we didn’t pay close attention to that detail when booking. Overall, we had a great experience and would happily stay here again.",
      "Excellent stay! Brandy communicated well and was very receptive to our feedback (2 fobs would be convenient if even possible). <br/>Very fun area, lots of activity and easy walk to Prince’s island.",
      "Brandy’s place was located in the city and walkable to a lot of restaurants. We were a party of 5 and unfortunately the sofa bed was broken when we arrived. She was very reasonable and accommodated us for the mishap. One thing to note was that the other room behind the washer and dryer can get really noisy if you’re running the appliances as they share a wall. If you time your washes right there should be no issues.",
      "We had a great stay at Renboga at Colours. The location was amazing with many things to do right around the area and within walking distance. We felt very safe in the apartment and the view from the balcony was amazing. The space was very clean and spacious. We highly recommend this place to anyone who might be visiting Calgary soon and wishing to stay right downtown.",
      "Wonderful condo. It was downtown, close to shops and restaurants and a great view from the balcony. The host was super friendly and easy to reach. Her directions were detailed which made it easy to check in",
      "It was the perfect place for two families to stay.<br/>We’d love to come back again for our next trip to Banff or calgary",
      "Brandy was really helpful and always responding. We asked if there was a possibility for early check-in and she managed to do this for us. Was amazing!",
      "Really good stay, just as described! Brandy was super responsive also! Would definitely return!",
      "Absolutely gorgeous place easy to get in responsive host at all time and super clean",
      "Great stay, clean and comfortable! Restaurants and nightlife nearby, walkable to Saddledome and much more!",

      "Great place in an excellent location! It had everything we needed, and the host was super responsive and helpful. Would definitely stay here again.",
      "Brandy's place was very accurately described, comfortable, and offered a lot of value for the money!",
      "I want to start off by saying that the arrival instructions were perfectly described and easy to follow.  The decor of this unit is sheek and upscale, with a little twist of humor (I'll leave that as a surprise).  The hostess has provided everything that you will need for your stay for a few days or two weeks (like myself).  I hope that this unit is available the next few times that I travel to the area over the next several months, as I will pick this place every time.<br/>I also want to talk about the location of this unit, it is perfectly located near the best restaurants in the area, great pubs, wine store, Asian market, and much more.  The location alone will have me coming back, and the unit was perfect for my business trip.  I have been a super host for over 10 years, and I don't think you will find anything in the area that will top this unit, the location, and the value.  Very well done!",
      "Great location, felt right at home, and was super clean!",
      "Great host, enjoyed my stay. Would recommend.",
      "Loved every minute of our stay at this location.<br/>We will definitely be booking again for next year's Stampede",

The decor of this unit is sheek and upscale, with a little twist of humor (I'll leave that as a surprise).  The hostess has provided everything that you will need for your stay for a few days or two weeks (like myself).  I hope that this unit is available the next few times that I travel to the area over the next several months, as I will pick this place every time.<br/>I also want to talk about the location of this unit, it is perfectly located near the best restaurants in the area, great pubs, wine store, Asian market, and much more.  The location alone will have me coming back, and the unit was perfect for my business trip.  I have been a super host for over 10 years, and I don't think you will find anything in the area that will top this unit, the location, and the value.  Very well done!",

      "We stayed for one week and really enjoyed our time here. The host was very responsive, available and attentive, always replying quickly and even coming by promptly when needed — it made everything easy and stress-free. The place is comfortable, just keep in mind it’s a basement unit, so there’s limited natural light and you might hear some noise from upstairs, but overall it’s a cozy and convenient stay.",
      "Very walkable area, super close to stampede grounds. Place is 15minutes from downtown, 15minutes from the grounds. Entrance to suite is a bit sketchy. Understand it is a basement suite and you will hear footsteps from the floor above. Overall loved the space for what it was.",
      "Awesome, awesome area. Walk to the river on one side and a lively 17th ave on the other! The house in in a quiet block and the surroundings are very lively and interesting.",
      "Joseph was an excellent host! Extremely responsive and had lots of great recommendations in the area. The location was perfect - right by 17th Ave and the suite had everything we needed for our stay in Calgary. I would definitely stay here again!",
      "It was the best location very close to 17th Ave and lots to do around. It was clean and exactly how it was described. Joseph was always very quick response and also recommended places to go around. It’s also walking distance to Stephan’s Ave. would definitely stay here again!!!!",
      "Great location. The basement is super quiet and private. Joseph was very communicative. Thanks 🙏",
      "I don’t tend to get wordy with my reviews, I’m very much a “great place, would stay again” kind of guy.<br/>We rented this suite as my wife was coming out the hospital and we really just needed a well equipped, safe and clean little area to decompress.<br/>Not only did the suite and amenities exceed our needs and expectations, our host suggested amazing local dining options that were equally 10 out of 10 options.<br/>Beautiful little suite. Quiet and peaceful space that quite frankly works great if you work remotely.<br/>My only tip for future renters: listen to the host’s restaurant recommendations closely; you won’t be disappointed.",
      "Joseph's place was perfect and cozy! He was also an incredible host, always responsive and helpful! 😀",
      "clean & cute place at prime location! Joseph was very helpful and gave many good recommendations for local restaurants. Would stay here again!",

Shopping and restaurants were close by which made the experience even better. Teresa was very kind and I would love to stay at her place if ever in the city again.",
      "We were really happy with the condo, exactly what we expected based on the listing. The proximity to the BMO Center and restaurants was really great since we prefer to walk when we can.",
      "The apartment was beautiful, wonderful views across downtown Calgary from the bedroom windows and balcony, everything we wanted to visit in Calgary was in walking distance and the train line was just a 10 minute walk from the apartment for going a wee bit further out of the city.<br/>The apartment was spotless and lovely dining area to sit and watch the skyline, with excellent cooking and laundry facilities.<br/>The gym excellent facilities for a condo, and each time I used it I was the only one in there.<br/>Very clear directions to the apartment and easy check in. Thanks for hosting us Teresa.",
      "thank you so much for putting a lot of care and thought into your apartment. it was the best apartments throughout our trip in Canada :)<br/>However, it did feel as if both the mattresses had lost their shape and form. I would suggest replacing them with firmer ones where you can sit on the side and not fall through.",
      "We enjoyed a few days in this lovely apartment with great views of the city from its high floor and great balcony. It was super clean with a really comfy bed with great secure underground parking, we easily fit our large car in the bay. About a 10 minute easy walk to Stephen Avenue which has a great atmosphere and loads of restaurants and bars to enjoy.  Can recommend Craft Beer Market a five minute walk from the apartment, has a rooftop bar and great beers and cocktails and the Nachos are huge and Ten Foot Henry if you like sharing plates. We wouldn’t hesitate to stay in Teresa’s apartment again.",
      "Beautiful place and location in downtown Calgary!  This was our first time visiting and the views from this condo were amazing!!!  We’d stay at Teresa’s place again if ever in Calgary!",

The building is beautiful and newer. It is a 5 minute walk to Stephen Street district with tons of shopping and dining choices. The condo itself is clean and modern, with lots of windows and great views from the 30th floor. The washer and dryer worked well as did everything else. Would definitely stay here again.",
      "Hands down the best AirBnB in this building. I've stayed in 3 other AirBnBs in this building, and Teresa's is the best. From the design to special touches to price to view. It's unbeatable!! I hope to stay there every time.",

      "Had issues getting into the building. The directory at the front wasn’t working and building concierge wasn’t at the front desk. One of the elevators was out of order, which caused our ‘buzz in’ to time out. Took us a total of 45 minutes to get into the suite. <br/>Teresa was responsive, and trying to assist over text. <br/>The place was great when we got in. Clean, well decorated, had family games and other small amenities.",
      "Teresa's place was as pictured. They were very responsive and helpful to all of our questions before and during our stay. This condo is near the top of the building, with a balcony and beautiful view. We stayed during winter so there was no pool available, and we didn't go to the fitness center.  We basically just slept/showered here and didn't use most of the things in the condo but the beds worked well. We would stay again.",
      "\"A Perfect Christmas Getaway!\"<br/>My family and I had a wonderful time spending the Christmas holiday at Teressa’s condo! The space was spotless and exactly as described. A thoughtful touch was the dark chocolate left on the counter, which my daughter absolutely loved. The condo offered stunning views and was in a very convenient location. I highly recommend it!",
      "Teresa goes above and beyond to make her place as comfortable as possible.  Condo was spotless and well appointed.",
      "Awesome apartment and wonderful location. It was easy to get to everywhere in downtown. Communication was great from the host"

It was super clean with a really comfy bed with great secure underground parking, we easily fit our large car in the bay. About a 10 minute easy walk to Stephen Avenue which has a great atmosphere and loads of restaurants and bars to enjoy.  Can recommend Craft Beer Market a five minute walk from the apartment, has a rooftop bar and great beers and cocktails and the Nachos are huge and Ten Foot Henry if you like sharing plates. We wouldn’t hesitate to stay in Teresa’s apartment again.",

Clean, well decorated, had family games and other small amenities.",

The concierge confirmed the buzzer system was working, but with one elevator temporarily out of service, we know it added to the delay. The elevator issue has since been resolved. We appreciate your patience and are glad you enjoyed the suite once inside. Thanks for your kind words, and we’d love to host you again for a smoother stay!"

      "Great stay in beautiful apartment. The unit was gorgeous and well equipped. Lots of space for 2 adults and 3 teenage boys. The balcony was huge and the apartment got a lot of sunlight.",
      "We had a great stay here. The apartment is very well equipped. The location is great for exploring Calgary with lots of sights in walking distance. It is quite noisy and there is a lot of homelessness/drug use in the area (particularly down the adjacent alley) but that seems to be unavoidable in the city.",
      "Great location. Everything was really easy but did have to access a different portal to Airbnb to get any info about the place or to check in. <br/>Space was really clean and had everything you needed. Main room with sofa bed has a lot of windows and no blinds which isn’t ideal for those sleeping there. Although eye masks were provided for them",
      "This was my first experience with Airbnb, Beth and her team have set the bar very high. Flawless experience for our girls trip (myself, my best friend of 30 years, and our two daughters).<br/>From answering questions early in the booking process, detailed instructions for all steps of our stay (including pictures), spotless unit, and quick response time, I couldn’t have asked for better. <br/>I have already forwarded her profile and listings to all of my colleagues, as we frequently travel to Calgary. I will not be booking hotels in the area again, as I plan on using Beth, her team, and their listings for future travels. <br/>Thank you to Beth and her team for helping to make our trip great!",
      "Great place to stay. The area is close to downtown and it feels safe at all times. Communication with the host was very prompt and friendly. <br/>The apartment is just like the picture, actually bigger in person. The only recommendation for summer visitors is the sun in the living room stays until 11 pm and there are not blinds in that area. If you have someone sleeping in there, Beth provides sleep mask that you will sure need. The sofa bed is smaller than expected, only for people 1.60 m or shorter. Everything else is great!",
      "We had a wonderful stay. The location was great with plenty of places to eat and a grocery store just down the street. Beth responded quickly and was very helpful. We would definitely stay again and would recommend to anyone looking for a place downtown.",
      "We had a great time in Calgary. Beth was super quick communicationing when we had a question. Great to work with. The place was perfectly placed for our convention and would be perfect for the Calgary Stampeders. Would definitely stay again.",
      "The place is spectacular,, very nice, great view, close to everything, great location and very clean. We would come back again.. I would recommend this place and a rate of five star.",
      "The unit was welcoming from the time we arrived. The units ample windows are warm and inviting on a fair weather days.  The location was perfect for our first time in The Beltline to explore midtown and uptown by 17 Avenue.  The balcony patio is a nicely situated to get some away time as there aren't too many high rises impeding the views. Kitchen was fairly well stocked enough to  do  the odd meal homecooked meal including patio BBQ. In suite laundry was good to have on our extended 4 day stay. Would highly recommend as a getaway for 4 guests or less.",
      "Great spot to stay at, very clean and right in the heart of Calgary. Definitely recommend this spot.",
      "The place was wonderful. The only thing we missed was a hook on the inside bathroom doors lol",
      "Great apartment. Lovely views. Supermarket is a 5 min walk away. Beth is a great host, would definitely book again.",
      "Beautiful high rise property in the heart of downtown. Walkable with lots to do. I enjoyed my stay. Thank you",
      "This place was perfect for our trip to Calgary. We loved the big windows that let in lots of light, the cozy and modern furnishings, and all the amenities it had to offer. The kitchen was well stocked and we were able to cook in but also walkable to many great restaurants that Calgary has to offer! The host was great and answered all our questions and very welcoming. Will definitely stay again!",
      "Great location downtown.  Close to lots of restaurants and shops.  Beds were good.  Underground parking is nice, but you have to go around and around i few times to get to the parking stall.  It's obvious has been a rental, scratches on the floor and multiple marks on the walls.   I would say it's nice but not impeccable.  Overall for the price tho and Location and the quick response of the renter I would recommend and I would stay here again.",
      "Such a great experience at the condo! This group was amazing for communication throughout the stay and check in was very easy. <br/>Condo offers beautiful views of the city and mountains in the distance. Condo is spacious and beds are very comfortable. Location was amazing to walk wherever you needed would highly recommend! <br/>Will definitely be back again,<br/>Thank you!",
      "Had a lovely stay at Beth’s property! The host was always responsive making sure we had everything needed during our stay! The detailed guide was extremely helpful well we were there they had listed everything you needed to know about the place and things to do around it! Would definitely recommend to stay with them I will be staying with them again!",

It is quite noisy and there is a lot of homelessness/drug use in the area (particularly down the adjacent alley) but that seems to be unavoidable in the city.",

Flawless experience for our girls trip (myself, my best friend of 30 years, and our two daughters).<br/>From answering questions early in the booking process, detailed instructions for all steps of our stay (including pictures), spotless unit, and quick response time, I couldn’t have asked for better. <br/>I have already forwarded her profile and listings to all of my colleagues, as we frequently travel to Calgary. I will not be booking hotels in the area again, as I plan on using Beth, her team, and their listings for future travels. <br/>Thank you to Beth and her team for helping to make our trip great!",

Communication with the host was very prompt and friendly. <br/>The apartment is just like the picture, actually bigger in person. The only recommendation for summer visitors is the sun in the living room stays until 11 pm and there are not blinds in that area. If you have someone sleeping in there, Beth provides sleep mask that you will sure need. The sofa bed is smaller than expected, only for people 1.60 m or shorter. Everything else is great!",

      "I thoroughly enjoyed staying here! Aisling is a wonderful host and created such a beautiful place to stay and enjoy! Beautiful decor, extremely comfy bed, spotless, and the view is just spectacular. Thank you so much Aisling for having us!",
      "this place has the best view out of 60 Air BNBs I've stayed in. This was our second time staying here and we would stay again it's always been clean and a convenient location. however if any other units are available in the building I usually opt for those due to the 10 AM check out time with this unit. Not a fan of the third party platforms to sign additional agreements and collect deposits etc. I actually kept getting an invalid phone message on this one which delayed my check in but all in all our stay was great.",
      "I really enjoyed my stay at this Airbnb! The location was convenient and within walking distance to many of the places I wanted to visit, which made exploring Calgary very easy. The view from the unit was absolutely beautiful and definitely one of the highlights. The hosts were very responsive and kind throughout the stay. There were a few checkout tasks required, but nothing too demanding. Overall, the experience was well worth it!",
      "It was a bit of a hassle as it was busy time and hard to find parking to than access the unit to get into the parking garage. It would have been helpful if I was advised were to go in the parking garage as there was up or down options. <br/>It was quite warm and the A/C didn’t work the time I stayed. <br/>The coffee table was very unstable and looked like it would break if u used it. <br/>The location was great and close to the stampede grounds. The host was quick to help and provide access when I left something in the unit after check out. It was great.",
      "The place is everything in the pictures and more. Conveniently located near the core and walkable. The area felt safe with amazing restaurants and pubs within walking distance. Apartment has all the amenities that you’d need for your stay and amazing views of the city. Highly recommend!!",
      "Amazing Views! Perfect location for walkable Calgary! Quick responses from hosts! We did utilize the parking garage which was very easy to maneuver. It had amazing bars, restaurants, and coffee shops all on the surrounding block. 8th and 17th was confidently close (on foot) for shopping and nightlife! We did drive to the National Parks a few days and found the city very easy to navigate. Avis rental is just a few blocks away as well. We would stay again!",
      "The view was spectacular!  And the layout was absolutely beautiful   looking forward to staying again soon.",
      "The host provided timely and complete instructions. The place was beautiful and is in a great location!",
      "I had a great time staying at Aisling Baile’s place! The condo was beautiful and very clean. I especially loved the city view at night it was absolutely stunning. There was plenty to do in the neighborhood, with lots of great restaurants nearby. I enjoyed it so much that I extended my stay, and I’m glad I did. I visit Calgary often, and I’ll definitely be booking this place again when I return.",
      "The apartment was clean and looks like the photos online. The bed was extremely comfortable and provided a great sleep. The apartment was located in a great part of the city and had a tremendous view. Located very close to restaurants and bars, even a Starbucks directly across the street. It was well worth the money.",

      "This is now my 2nd time staying here, I enjoyed it so much last time so wished I booked for longer",
      "The place was conveniently located based on our itinerary. There are plentiful of restaurants nearby and very walkable area. The place looked just like the photos and was clean. I appreciated how quick and responsive Aisling Baile was! The one downside was that the sofa had a broken leg so we weren’t able to comfortably lounge about after a long day. This was out of their control, but an elevator was down which was a bit inconvenient during our stay. <br/>Overall, the place had everything we needed and Aisling Baile were great hosts and I would recommend this place! <br/>P.S. the parking is between two pillars so I wouldn’t suggest driving a big car (e.g. truck) if you want to take advantage of the free parking spot.",

This was our second time staying here and we would stay again it's always been clean and a convenient location. however if any other units are available in the building I usually opt for those due to the 10 AM check out time with this unit. Not a fan of the third party platforms to sign additional agreements and collect deposits etc. I actually kept getting an invalid phone message on this one which delayed my check in but all in all our stay was great.",

It would have been helpful if I was advised were to go in the parking garage as there was up or down options. <br/>It was quite warm and the A/C didn’t work the time I stayed. <br/>The coffee table was very unstable and looked like it would break if u used it. <br/>The location was great and close to the stampede grounds. The host was quick to help and provide access when I left something in the unit after check out. It was great.",

It had amazing bars, restaurants, and coffee shops all on the surrounding block. 8th and 17th was confidently close (on foot) for shopping and nightlife! We did drive to the National Parks a few days and found the city very easy to navigate. Avis rental is just a few blocks away as well. We would stay again!",

This was out of their control, but an elevator was down which was a bit inconvenient during our stay. <br/>Overall, the place had everything we needed and Aisling Baile were great hosts and I would recommend this place! <br/>P.S. the parking is between two pillars so I wouldn’t suggest driving a big car (e.g. truck) if you want to take advantage of the free parking spot.",

      "Had issues at check in, hosts wouldn’t provide me with a number to call and sort the issues. Only messaged through app. Provided me with a code to dial and they never answered to buzz me in, all other codes provided after did not work. After an hour of unable to check in had to get air bnb involved. They swiftly found me another unit  in same area at 8:30pm. Terrible hosts and terrible customer service.",
      "The place was super comfy and had everything I needed for a relaxing stay. The host was absolutely amazing and helpful throughout my visit. I would definitely stay here again and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a great stay!",
      "Stayed for 3 nights during summer. Had everything that we needed.<br/>Great location in the heart of downtown CGY with plenty of restaurants, cafes, and bars within a 5 min. walk.",
      "Stayed here during Stampede week, and had a pretty mixed experience. Got into the building without issue, but instructions regarding entering the unit were unclear/required correction from co-host. Empty water bottle and mouthwash left behind in the bathroom from a previous tenant, empty beer case full of garbage on the patio and dishes in the cupboard requiring re-cleaning before use. We were able to get responses quickly from the co-host which was a plus, and the apartment is true to the images listed and in a fantastic walkable spot in town.<br/>For the price we paid, we would rather have spent the same to stay in a hotel in a less convenient location, to avoid the complications. (It also gets quite warm without A/C in the unit)",
      "Good place to stay, as we attended a Convention at the nearby Stampede Park.  All clean & tidy. Great bed. Thank you.<br/>Good instructions to enter building and unit, however once we entered, there were no instructions that there was no key, but a garage fob (we had no car) was also the fob to use to enter the building after the 1st time, and to use for the lifts to access the required floor, and that when leaving the unit, and to get into the unit again, there were numbers to use on the door (the unit was open when we arrived). I had to email to find out all these instructions! so not that was not user friendly, especially as we had arrived after a nearly 10 hour flight!<br/>Also when we departed, there was a long email which i did not read beyond the 1st sentence asking for certain things we should do. I only saw the first sentence. I was in a rush to leave. Irecommend the host sends such a departure email 2 days before departure date and then again on evening before departure.<br/>Many thanks.",
      "There were a few issues that led me to leave shortly after check-in. Communication before arrival was unclear—especially around personal info required due to Calgary regulations, which wasn’t properly explained. Check-in instructions were missing and had to be sent manually. I couldn’t be buzzed in and had to follow someone else, and the door code wasn’t immediately available. The co-host wasn’t very apologetic, which added to the frustration.<br/>Inside, there were dirty dishes in the sink and dishwasher, and the towels didn’t appear clean. The bed was technically made, but the pillows were disheveled, it made me question whether it had been cleaned properly.<br/>That said, the location was great, and I believe this may have been a one-off situation due to miscommunication and oversight. While I wouldn’t rebook, I encourage others to read recent reviews and give it a chance if the host has addressed these issues.",
      "there was a few questions around checking in and wifi log in but the host were very responsive. very comfortable apartment in a great<br/>location. Shower was great. had good coffee and kitchen was well stock. definitely would recommend to others.",

      "A nice open layout, clean and comfortable. Conveniently located downtown with access to everything nearby. Would stay again!",
      "Great place to stay. Nice and quite with plenty of restaurants around and close to downtown core.",
      "Excellent location and this apartment is very quiet, very well located. There are great options for restaurants and bars in the surroundings, very practical. And there is also the Sunterra food market two blocks away and 8 minutes from 17 Ave SW, which has many restaurants.",
      "The accommodation is located in the middle and within walking distance of all events! Stampede, Stephen Ave, 17th Avenue!  It was really very pleasant and I will go back next year for sure!  Thanks to the hosts for the quick communication despite our late arrival, I recommend them!!!",
      "Thank you",
      "Communicated great, clean place and lots of help!",

Sandwiched between 17 ave and Stephen Ave which is perfect if you want to see a blend of restaurants and retail stores. Would recommend and definitely will come back for a future use!",

Only messaged through app. Provided me with a code to dial and they never answered to buzz me in, all other codes provided after did not work. After an hour of unable to check in had to get air bnb involved. They swiftly found me another unit  in same area at 8:30pm. Terrible hosts and terrible customer service.",

        "review": "Stayed here during Stampede week, and had a pretty mixed experience. Got into the building without issue, but instructions regarding entering the unit were unclear/required correction from co-host. Empty water bottle and mouthwash left behind in the bathroom from a previous tenant, empty beer case full of garbage on the patio and dishes in the cupboard requiring re-cleaning before use. We were able to get responses quickly from the co-host which was a plus, and the apartment is true to the images listed and in a fantastic walkable spot in town.<br/>For the price we paid, we would rather have spent the same to stay in a hotel in a less convenient location, to avoid the complications. (It also gets quite warm without A/C in the unit)",

Thank you.<br/>Good instructions to enter building and unit, however once we entered, there were no instructions that there was no key, but a garage fob (we had no car) was also the fob to use to enter the building after the 1st time, and to use for the lifts to access the required floor, and that when leaving the unit, and to get into the unit again, there were numbers to use on the door (the unit was open when we arrived). I had to email to find out all these instructions! so not that was not user friendly, especially as we had arrived after a nearly 10 hour flight!<br/>Also when we departed, there was a long email which i did not read beyond the 1st sentence asking for certain things we should do. I only saw the first sentence. I was in a rush to leave. Irecommend the host sends such a departure email 2 days before departure date and then again on evening before departure.<br/>Many thanks.",

        "review": "There were a few issues that led me to leave shortly after check-in. Communication before arrival was unclear—especially around personal info required due to Calgary regulations, which wasn’t properly explained. Check-in instructions were missing and had to be sent manually. I couldn’t be buzzed in and had to follow someone else, and the door code wasn’t immediately available. The co-host wasn’t very apologetic, which added to the frustration.<br/>Inside, there were dirty dishes in the sink and dishwasher, and the towels didn’t appear clean. The bed was technically made, but the pillows were disheveled, it made me question whether it had been cleaned properly.<br/>That said, the location was great, and I believe this may have been a one-off situation due to miscommunication and oversight. While I wouldn’t rebook, I encourage others to read recent reviews and give it a chance if the host has addressed these issues.",

      "I was impressed with how responsive Richard & Teresa were. Any time I had an issue OI heard back quickly. The apartment is a quick walk to my office so was extremely convenient and also close to restaurants and shopping. The apartment was spotless, well decorated and had all the amenities of a hotel room and more - the snack bowl was a godsend as I demolished that with late night munchy attacks.<br/>Worth the money and I would highly recommend staying there again - I certainly will be.",
      "Great place for a quick trip to Calgary but would gladly stay again for longer if we could. Exactly as shown in photos and Richard&Teresa were extremely prompt when replying to any questions or concerns. Even with the train tracks close by, it was very quiet and you really only heard the trains if you were outside (which was a great view). We even caught a glimpse of a parade going by downtown from the balcony. Highly recommended. Well stocked kitchen, bathroom, bedroom. 10/10",

We even caught a glimpse of a parade going by downtown from the balcony. Highly recommended. Well stocked kitchen, bathroom, bedroom. 10/10",

      "Calgary was a bucket list trip for us; Kyle and Andrew raised the bar on hosting.  Great location to experience Calgary and amazing Canadian hospitality.  Perfect for remote work and savoring food on par with New Orleans.",
      "We had a wonderful stay! The place was very clean and well appointed and the location was great! We arrived just as the Calgary Stampede was happening and had a fantastic view of the opening parade! Check in was seamless with the easy instructions and the underground carpark location was great. We would absolutely stay again and would highly recommend it!",
      "Kyle's listing was as advertised.<br/>Very good location, clean, and comfortable.<br/>I would recommend it to other travelers.<br/>If you plan on using the parking garage, be advised that the spot is next to a large pole. We had a midsized SUV and it just fit. Anything bigger would have been pretty difficult to park in the spot provided. It could be done, but it would be very tight with the car in the next spot.",
      "Great place to stay! I had issues with my travel arrangements getting there and they were able to accommodate a late check in for me, definitely recommend these guys!",
      "Kyle & Andrew were great hosts.   I come to Calgary a lot so I'll defiantly be booking with them again!",
      "Great experience. Kyle was very responsive and accommodating.  Beautiful place with amazing views. Looking forward to staying again soon:)",
      "Would stay here again. It’s on the 25th floor so free from street noise but you can hear the trains. There are amazing views of the mountains and sunsets. The place had everything we needed for the few days we were there, kitchen cleaning stuff, coffee, laundry tablets, bathroom supplies.",

      "The room was beautiful and had the most beautiful view.  We were even lucky enough to see a few beautiful sunsets. Quick replies and Kyle made sure we had everything we needed. <br/>Would definitely stay here again.",
      "Kyle and Andrew were great hosts. Coffee included with my stay, easy check in, and a beautiful apartment.<br/>Walkable to many great restaurants and lots to do. I can into town for business and will definitely be trying to book with Kyan again.<br/>Don’t hesitate to book with them!<br/>Thanks Guys",

      "A great stay with a great view. The apartment was tidy and had everything we needed for our time there.  Check in was clearly explained and easy to access the secure parking.  Kyle was very responsive with any information we needed. Would definitely stay here again for an easy downtown Calgary trip.",
      "Great location. Very clean building/ unit with an amazing view.<br/>Everything was high quality from the bed to the appliances, with good quality utensils  (not a dollar store item in sight). The host was very responsive and took extra steps to make my stay memorable. I look forward to my next trip to calgary. 100% satisfied, airbb textbook example.",
      "Amazing place, truly clean and private. It had the best views of the mountains while still allowing natural sunlight in. The hosts were incredibly responsive and helpful. They had coffee provided which is the first I’ve ever seen. I had an amazing stay and would 100% recommend this place for anyone visiting the Calgary area!",

      "Mega Lage in Calgary!<br/>Especially convenient is the parking which is included.<br/>Modern amenities and great views from the balcony!<br/>Unfortunately, our hair dryer and remote control were missing, which was then delivered to us the next noon.",
      "Kyle and Andrew were great hosts and their communication was always on point! The building is in a nice location to everything downtown and very secure. We had a car there and I was really pleased with the safe underground parking. Definitely recommend staying if visiting downtown Calgary!"

If I ever find myself in Calgary again, I would absolutely choose to stay here without a second thought. Highly recommended!",
      "I had a great stay here! Would definitely recommend. Very close to everything you need especially during stampede weekend. Very glad there was designated parking and a very nice balcony. The host was very responsive and ensured I had everything I needed for the stay. The place was clean and roomy. Thanks for the great stay!!",
      "Kyle’s place was a perfect home base for our stay in Calgary. We were in the city for a convention at the BMO Centre and Saddledome. It was an easy walk - less than 20 minutes.<br/>The location was also perfect for restaurants- so many and great variety within a few blocks.<br/>Kyle and Andrew were always very responsive. We had a minor issue and they sent someone over right away to address it.",
      "Location, location, location. Heart of Mission for all the happenings and walkable to downtown for work. Unit was squeaky clean.",
      "This was a great spot close to Red Mile. I would stay there again.",
      "Had a short but nice stay at Kyle & Andrew's place in Calgary. Check-in was easy and the place was very clean and cute! Thanks for a great stay.",
      "My stay was great. The hosts were responsive and easy to communicate with. The spot felt like home right away. The location was perfect! Easily walkable or a short ride share to just about everything I wanted to do. I would book again in a heartbeat.",
      "Everything perfect. Amazing location.",
      "very responsive. clean. no problems at all. I would stay again.",
      "Convient place to stay for a last minute booking. Thanks!",
      "Great stay, Great location and great communication!  Would definitely stay again!",
      "It was a great place to stay, I would definitely come back again",
      "Good location and parking included. Nicely decorated and well equipped. Check in was quite good, although host needs to communicate first contact and buzz in is for BOTH front doors. Why is key in unit when code only is required and stated as to be used for remainder of stay. Directions to parking around the block should say \"4th St\" not \"2nd St.\"",
      "Thank you for a comfy 4 night stay.  The apartment was exactly as photographed.  The kitchen was well appointed with new appliances.  The bed was very comfortable.  I appreciated the designated parking stall.  You made check in and check out very easy.  I will stay again upon a return visit to Calgary.",
      "Great location! Walkable. Host was responsive. AC was broken but host provided fans the next day. The bed and pillows could be more comfortable. Otherwise, the stay was great for what we needed.",
      "The place was very clean and well-maintained. The host was communicative and made the check-in process easy. The location is perfect, with tons of restaurants just a short walk away. I had a great stay!",
      "Kyle’s place was clean and tidy , we stayed 11days so the washing machine was good . <br/>We walked everywhere in Calgary , it was never too far from Kyle’s Airbnb. <br/>We enjoyed our stay very much",
      "The check in instructions were very detailed but it says that the alley parking is off 2nd Street when it is actually 4th, which made it a bit confusing. I saw another review mention this error as well. <br/>The apartment had an AC unit in the bedroom which was nice, but it was leaking water as the carpet was damp and there was a bowl placed under it. <br/>The location is excellent, close enough to walk to Stampede and Saddledome area and also near a number of great restaurants."

The place is gorgeous, has a beautiful view, is in the heart of downtown but also very quiet ( we heard nothing when we were at home, no noise whatsoever from neighbours or neighbourhood), warm during the coldest days of the month. Nima prepared a very detailed booklet that had all the details about the unit and how to operate things. He was extremely kind, respectful and always answered any questions we had with care. Oh and also the concierges were truely kind and helpful whenever we chatted :) Loved the building, loved the house and loved how the host interacted with us. %100 recommend the place to everyone.

You can lower this by pressing the down button. \n<br>\nGive it a few seconds, you may see the High setpoint flashing again but now the thermostat goes in Auto and you should see the green light coming on which means the AC has kicked in.\n<br>\nAs mentioned the chillers for the building might be off and will be turned on towards end of May. Might want to have the windows open to provide some additional cooling.\n</span>\n",

The place is gorgeous, has a beautiful view, is in the heart of downtown but also very quiet ( we heard nothing when we were at home, no noise whatsoever from neighbours or neighbourhood), warm during the coldest days of the month. Nima prepared a very detailed booklet that had all the details about the unit and how to operate things. He was extremely kind, respectful and always answered any questions we had with care. Oh and also the concierges were truely kind and helpful whenever we chatted :) Loved the building, loved the house and loved how the host interacted with us. %100 recommend the place to everyone.

However, your location rating of 3 out of 5 based on proximity of my place to Banff seems unfair. My unit as advertised is in downtown Calgary and located on the SW side of it which is quite close to the highway leading up to Banff. My unit is located in a great location with walking access to various prominent neighborhoods. I suggest in the future to consider staying in town of Canmore that is close to Banff but I can't control the proximity of downtown Calgary to city of Banff."

      "Location was perfect, easy to walk throughout downtown Calgary from the apartment! Main issue was the AC wasn’t working at all. Our only saving grace was that the smoke cooled down the weather outside. Yes, the host was responsive and gave us a couple of fans to help us out but… I really don’t know what we would’ve done if the weather would’ve been hotter. The apartment is south facing and one of the bedrooms is south/west facing so it lets in a lot of sun. We did have the blinds closed during the day too. <br/>Otherwise… great location, was clean, and had a nice city view. Beds are on the softer side. Building was secure, underground parking spot was a nice plus.",

Our only saving grace was that the smoke cooled down the weather outside. Yes, the host was responsive and gave us a couple of fans to help us out but… I really don’t know what we would’ve done if the weather would’ve been hotter. The apartment is south facing and one of the bedrooms is south/west facing so it lets in a lot of sun. We did have the blinds closed during the day too. <br/>Otherwise… great location, was clean, and had a nice city view. Beds are on the softer side. Building was secure, underground parking spot was a nice plus.",

We apologize that the AC wasn’t fully effective during your stay and appreciate your patience while we provided fans. We’re taking steps to improve this for future guests. Thank you for staying with us, and we’d be happy to host you again."

      "We had a wonderful stay at Anna’s place!! The apartment was just as pictured with gorgeous views. The location was absolutely perfect and walking distance to everywhere we needed to go. Anna was a wonderful and very responsive host and made the check in/check out process super smooth for us. Would definitely stay here again!",
      "I recommend the Anna’s place.  Nice location, nice view and clean unit.  And had everything I needed in the unit.  The communication was excellent.  I would stay here again.",
      "This was the perfect place for my short time in Calgary. Central and nice area to walk around also. <br/>The apartment has great views and the host was responsive and helpful. <br/>Would definitely book it again.",
      "I can't wait to stay here again! I loved the location: walkable, restaurants galore, best bars, etc...I felt safe and people were really friendly. The space was beautiful and had everything I needed - including Nespresso coffee. The views were spectacular; I enjoyed waking up to the sunrise from the bed. This place invigorated me in so many ways! <br/>Anna was extremely responsive and her communication truly showed how much she cares for her guests. Highly recommend!",
      "I stayed for two weeks with my teenage son. Thanks to Anna, we were able to enjoy a safe and comfortable environment, along with a room that offered a wonderful view. It was truly an unforgettable experience in my life.<br/>The location is close to downtown, and there are two supermarkets nearby, which made cooking very convenient. A sofa bed was also provided, making the room spacious and comfortable.<br/>I highly recommend this place, especially for parents traveling with their children:)",
      "This was a perfect condo for my trip. The location is prime, the condo is spacious, well equipped and very modern, and the host is very nice and helpful. Very suitable for both short and longer term stays in Calgary.",
      "You just can’t beat the location and the views. The place had everything we needed and the bed was comfy. We were there for 2 nights and slept great! Nice work station too.",
      "Anna’s condo was great.  Loved the location which was walkable to many restaurants and shops in the heart of the city.  It was nice not having to worry about parking being so close to everything.",
      "Great place to stay! Clean, easy check-in/out, convenient location in city, quiet building, loved the corner unit. No issues at all, Anna was a great host, would highly recommend to others!",
      "Great location with much walkable food and amenities near by. Amazing view of the city and skyline of the mountains on the horizon. The full Calgary experience.",
      "Great place to spend a few nights in Calgary. Near great restaurants and coffee shops. Very walkable. Clean and cozy.",
      "Anna’s beautiful place was perfect for our stay in Calgary!  An easy walk to and from BMO Center/Saddledome/Stampede grounds.  The bedroom doors close so a second person can stay up later and watch TV in the living room which has a good sofa bed.  A walk-in shower and a bath/shower combo were a bonus. Great closet space and laundry.  All the apartment features made for a comfortable and wonderful multi-day stay.  Anna is the BEST kind of host…communicates clearly, responds quickly.  She answered my many questions about the neighborhood which as a first-timer to that part of Canada, I GREATLY appreciated!   I highly recommend this place!",
      "Anna was a great host.  Her place was as described and was everything I expected.  Her place is in a great neighbour and very close to everything downtown.  The only draw back to the building is having to use the fob to exit the parkade, finding a place to park on the street, and then returning the fob to the unit.",
      "Anna’s place was exactly as described. We will definitely return. Highly recommend.",
      "Great space to stay for a quick trip.  Anna was extremely responsive to all questions.",
      "We loved our stay at Anna’s apartment, it was comfortable, clean and had everything we needed there. Location was perfect too. Would definitely stay there again!",
      "Can't say enough about this place - bed was firm and super supportive and comfortable - couldn't even feel my partner who typically tosses all night.  The water pressure was a pleasant surprise - very powerful!  room darkening blinds really help because this unit has windows on 2 sides, which gives a very open roominess feel.  The location was perfect as our son was competing at the nearby MNP sport complex, less than a 10 min walk away and the unit was so close to 17th avenue where there is incredible nightlife and energy.  <br/>Anna was extremely pro-active on the happenings of the condo complex and an excellent communicator with great recommendations.  Typically responded to text messages in less than 2 minutes.  It felt like we were her top priority.  The Nespresso machine and pods was also a nice touch as were the granola bars and microwave popcorn (which we took advantage of having arrived at 10pm).  Great place - we will come back for sure!!",
      "we stumbled across Anna's rental when our original rental had some plumbing issues they couldn't fix immediately. The unit is in a great location, and Anna was very accommodating with it being a last minute booking. we will definitely be back as this place has a great vibe to it.",
      "Very clean centrally located.  Lovely views.  Easy walking distance to restaurants and shopping.  Very clear instructions how to get in and leave.  Host was available and responded immediately to any questions we asked. The unit was pristine and had everything available to make our stay enjoyable.  We highly recommend this unit and we would love to stay there again if/and when we might visit Calgary in the future.  Thank you for making our Christmas memorable.<br/>Lila & Ron Tucker",
      "Anna’s place is in a great location, surrounded by great restaurants and coffee spots.<br/>It was clean, quiet, and easy to access. It was a great value compared to hotels in the area.",

The water pressure was a pleasant surprise - very powerful!  room darkening blinds really help because this unit has windows on 2 sides, which gives a very open roominess feel.  The location was perfect as our son was competing at the nearby MNP sport complex, less than a 10 min walk away and the unit was so close to 17th avenue where there is incredible nightlife and energy.  <br/>Anna was extremely pro-active on the happenings of the condo complex and an excellent communicator with great recommendations.  Typically responded to text messages in less than 2 minutes.  It felt like we were her top priority.  The Nespresso machine and pods was also a nice touch as were the granola bars and microwave popcorn (which we took advantage of having arrived at 10pm).  Great place - we will come back for sure!!",

      "Location was ideal for our appointments downtown. The place was smaller than we thought but still comfortable. Since I am somewhat of a neat freak, I did notice a few places that could have a quick wipe down and better attention to small repairs. The space was more on the warm side. Open windows during the night helped. Clear communication with host. Overall a good stay!",
      "Good cozy spot with everything you need for a stay. Very clean and lots of restaurants around. Host was very nice just a little hard to get a hold of leading up to check in but overall a good experience.",
      "Very lovely place to stay and in a great location! Had no issues: check-in was easy, home was clean, and the place had great amenities. Honestly I'd love to stay here every time I come to Calgary haha. Thanks again Emily!",
      "In a really nice part of Calgary - good bars and restaurants close by and a reasonably short walk to the centre of town. The apartment was quiet and very airy in the quite warm weather. Because it's a corner apartment, when the windows are open the breeze really blows through. The balcony and walk in closet also make the apartment feel spacious. Basement car parking is a big plus too. Would not hesitate to return when we are next in Calgary.",
      "Overall, it was a really great stay! The property was as described and in a really great neighbourhood, especially if you like Asian cuisine. However, the air conditioning was not working. Luckily it wasn't during a heat wave, but we would have appreciated a heads-up so we can make adjustments to our travel. Thanks for the great stay!",
      "We have stayed in this building before because of its amazing location. It's walkable to the stampede grounds and the amazing strip of restaurants just a couple blocks away. We loved Emily's place - super clean, amenities as described, and the portable A/C worked well enough to keep it reasonable in the place on a 30+C day. Thanks for the great stay Emily!",
      "This is a perfect place if you want to get a taste of downtown life with a bit of privacy. Extremely close to many restaurants and bars on 4th St or 17th Ave, and very walkable in all directions. The home has everything you would need and hosts were quick and responsive, and provided what the average traveler may need. Calgary was a wonderful place to visit and this was the perfect spot to base out of for the trip.",
      "This was my second time at this place and once again, everything was perfect! The apartment is great clean, comfortable, and exactly like the photos. Communication with Emily is always easy and pleasant.",
      "Nothing but positive experiences during our stay and would highly recommend. It was a great location within walking distance to great restaurants. We'll definitely be back!",
      "Emily has really made it feel like a home. Everything you need is provided. The building and surrounding area is quiet and clean. The in-suite washing machine was very handy!  Lovely furniture, comfortable bed and beautiful views of the neighborhood. I would definitely stay there again!",
      "Modern and well equipped,  Emily's apartment is ideally situated. Communication was smooth,  highly recommended",
      "Great property in a nice area,  very responsive and friendly host and great value for money. Hope to be back again!",
      "We really enjoyed our stay while visiting Calgary. It’s in a great location, walking distance to everything. It’s very comfortable, spotless and welcoming!",
      "Great location! Really enjoyed staying here as it was walkable to all of our destinations. I should have read the listing more thoroughly as the parking garage has a 6ft height limit so I was unable to park underground which is a large part of the reason I booked this location. Other than that the host was very responsive and the place had everything I needed.",
      "Emily's place was as listed, a great place to stay away from home.",
      "Emily’s place was amazing for us especially the location as it was convenient and close to a lot of places we wanted to go to!",
      "Emily's place was a lovely oasis in downtown Calgary. Spotlessly clean, comfortable, quiet, with a bathtub and balcony. Downtown Calgary is a bit rough, but this apartment felt safe. Emily was extremely responsive and accommodating. Highly recommend!",
      "Everything was great! Emily was helpful and accommodating. The place was very comfortable, had a great view, and was very walkable. There was even a nice little balcony! The kitchen was also super well equipped and the bed was comfortable. Would come here again!",
      "Lovely clean condo<br/>Excellent location",
      "Beautiful place and lovely location!",
      "This is my first Airbnb!<br/>The place was so comfortable and nice.<br/>The kitchen, bathroom, and bedroom were all tidy.<br/>It was close to 17th Street and the surroundings were safe.<br/>The parking lot was also convenient.<br/>If I can go to Calgary again, I want to stay at Emily's house again!",
      "Good stay for a short trip, close to many things!",
      "We had a great stay.   The condo was nice and comfortable.",

The apartment was quiet and very airy in the quite warm weather. Because it's a corner apartment, when the windows are open the breeze really blows through.

      "Place is great very close to 17th av for everything you need grocery store restaurants bars pubs everything. The place was good garage just fit a f150 truck in it which was nice to park it inside. The place was nice lots of stairs so be prepared. The ac was lacking in the upper level but he did have a few fans which helped some. Would rent again.",
      "Great convenient location. 1 short block to all<br/>The shop and restaurants on 17th. House has 4 bedrooms and 4.5 bathrooms.  House is next to medium sized street so there will be some traffic noise but not too bad. Overall, a very pleasant stay!",
      "Great location and great space! Very convenient to tons of restaurants, bars and cafes. We were a group of 5 and it was nice to have plenty of space. Owners were very helpful and responsive.",
      "stayed here for a work trip, really enjoyed<br/> perfect spot. walkable to restaurants and bars. central to everything. very comfortable. and if I had any questions they answered very quickly!",
      "We stayed at SuavStays for a work trip. There were 4 comfortable bedrooms, 3 full baths and 2 half baths. The place was perfect for our work stay with everyone having their own spot and great gathering areas on the main floor. <br/>We had a minivan and it did not want to get in the garage. Steven arranged a street parking pass and there was always a spot on the surrounding streets for it.<br/>The key thing is the location cannot be beat. It is right on 17th with great options for dining and a 25 minute walk to the Stampede grounds.<br/>Steven was extremely great at communication and answered any questions quickly.<br/>To ensure that you have all this space downtown the spot is very efficient with stairs up and down.",
      "This excellent location is central to everything our group wanted to do during our stay. It’s walking distance to an amazing mix of restaurants, pubs and shops!<br/>The design and decor give great vibes and the layout is perfect for a larger group, with the bedrooms nicely spaced to provide privacy, each with their own en suite or bathroom. <br/>Steven and Trae responded quickly to all of our questions with helpful answers and suggestions and just made us feel very well taken care of!<br/>Overall, this rental was the cherry on top for our group’s trip to such a cool area of Calgary.",

      "We stayed at this Airbnb for one week and loved it! It’s very spacious for our group of 6 people and had everything we needed. The area is lovely and walkable. We explored and ate at many restaurants nearby.",
      "From the initial booking, Steven was incredibly responsive. When it came to checking in, it was extremely easy and he gave us some tips and tricks to make sure it was smooth. <br/>The beds and pillows were extremely comfortable and the a/c was amazing to have; the basement was so incredibly cool. <br/>The spacious kitchen was definitely a plus and the amount of room you get in the fridge made it easy to have everything we needed in there. <br/>Location wise, it was a $7 uber ride to and from downtown which was amazing for our group.",
      "The host was great and communicated well. Only complaint was the house did have some dirty spots (food splatter all along kitchen wall, mold under dish rack, coffee creamer and food items all over counter upon arrival, etc).",

      "Our stay was amazing. We had a group who were all going to a conference and we all had comfortable rooms, clean areas to meet and socialize and the area had so many great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants within walking distance it was great. There was so much within walking distance - downtown, BMO center/Stampede grounds, the location is perfect. Stephen had great communication, he checked in on us and made sure that we had the instructions for what we needed and he was very responsive when I had a couple questions about the house.  The house itself was beautiful, the kitchen was well stocked and stunning!  The fact that it had so many bathrooms really made it easy for all of us to get ready for our event.  The master suite even has a gorgeous soaker tub.  Having a garage to park in was a big plus!  Definitely a 5 star stay and I would happily stay there again.",
      "Stayed here with 2 colleagues to attend a downtown conference. Was just perfect for our needs. Conveniently located.",
      "Overall stay was good. Although a few technical difficulties, Steven stayed in constant contact to make sure we were satisfied and treated us as supreme guests. <br/>I highly recommend the space, the area and the hosts. <br/>Thank you Steven for a great stay."

Steven arranged a street parking pass and there was always a spot on the surrounding streets for it.<br/>The key thing is the location cannot be beat. It is right on 17th with great options for dining and a 25 minute walk to the Stampede grounds.<br/>Steven was extremely great at communication and answered any questions quickly.<br/>To ensure that you have all this space downtown the spot is very efficient with stairs up and down.",

We had a group who were all going to a conference and we all had comfortable rooms, clean areas to meet and socialize and the area had so many great coffee shops, pubs and restaurants within walking distance it was great. There was so much within walking distance - downtown, BMO center/Stampede grounds, the location is perfect. Stephen had great communication, he checked in on us and made sure that we had the instructions for what we needed and he was very responsive when I had a couple questions about the house.  The house itself was beautiful, the kitchen was well stocked and stunning!  The fact that it had so many bathrooms really made it easy for all of us to get ready for our event.  The master suite even has a gorgeous soaker tub.  Having a garage to park in was a big plus!  Definitely a 5 star stay and I would happily stay there again.",

      "Richard’s Airbnb was clean and in a great location. We had a bit of difficulty reaching him at check-in, and the door code wasn’t working right away. But overall, I would recommend this Airbnb.",
      "Outstanding location in the heart of a great area. Loads of shopping and restaurants are immediately at your reach. Perfect hideaway in the middle of the city. Well equipped and comfortable. I’ll be staying here again on my next visit.",
      "The apartment it was very nice and spacious, in a safety area and close to the principal attractions. Just to mention, during the night there were a bit of noise but nothing serious.<br/>We would raccomend you stay.",
      "The accomodation was in pristine condition and in a great central location in Calgary. The apartment block is older but the apartment is much more modern! There was some noise from the pub next door until 1am but it's during the middle of the stampede week so to be expected. Richard was super quick with responses and really attentive throughout! Would definitely stay here again without question",
      "Richard was very responsive and helpful during our stay. We appreciated being able to check in at such a late hour with the ease of door codes. The rental was spacious, with lots of closet space to hang clothing, and a lot of counter space in the kitchen for making meals. The proximity to 17th Ave was great.",
      "the Appartement was not as expected but Richard was great to help and get things solved.<br/>The area an the backside is not nice but location in walking distance to downtown is good!",
      "Richard was extremely responsive and communicative! The place itself was perfect for us, very clean and located in an ideal spot for downtown activities. Would recommend!",
      "What a great little place. Cozy and exactly as described. The apartment was located in the heart of the Beltline where all the action was. Richard was kind, accommodating and responsive. Would<br/>definitely stay here again.",
      "richard was very friendly, informative and helpful. apartment was as listed and shown, although there was only one towel provided. location was great, easy to find and comfortable. definitely recommend for a weekend getaway!",
      "Richard’s place was so close to restaurants on 17th so it was perfect ! <br/>instructions were very clear for both front and back doors .",
      "Great stay, close to everything we needed downtown. Clean place with a host of proactive communication",
      "Richard was polite and responded quickly. <br/>The location was great, with plenty of bars and cafés nearby.",
      "Greats spot in the city with only a short walk to 17th and very reasonable price!",
      "Lovely stay! The place was comfortable and Richard was super responsive.",
      "Great apartment, great location, great host! Highly recommend.",
      "Great spot!<br/>Private space just off busy 17th. Perfect location. Great value and photos matched. I will be staying here again!",
      "Awesome place to stay. Host was communicative and check in was smooth. Definitely recommend",
      "Great studio in an even better location. Richard was easy to communicate with and helped us whenever we needed it. Perfect stay during the stampede.",
      "The unit was clean. Very good location, only 5-10 minutes walk to the bars and restaurants.<br/>Richard was  great, responsible and communicative.",
      "The place was very good and location was close to all the restaurants and bars. Lots to do there on 17 ave.<br/>Richard was also great and very responsive.",
      "great place! full unit airbnbs are always nice as you have everything you need in full privacy. great spot to crash after long days, impressive care taken to every detail before guests arrive. the area can be noisy and some unsavory types may be stalking around the premises, but the windows block a lot of noise and multiple keycodes are used to get inside, so no one can follow you. the airbnb itself is a 5/5, just keep your eyea open in the general area. id stay here again!",
      "Great place to stay! Richard was very accommodating and was very helpful. Check in was 10/10 very easy and the place is very close to everything. Would definitely recommend staying here!",
      "Really loved this place, just a perfect studio close to some great bars and restaurants and reasonable walking distance to everywhere else. The place was in excellent condition when I arrived and clearly managed by professionals (and I mean that in the best way). <br/>If you're staying on the weekend and actually want to get to sleep at a reasonable hour, the walls are pretty thin and there were people partying loudly well past midnight, but it wasn't an issue for me since I was out late and stay up late in general. There wasn't any noise on Sunday or the weekdays I stayed, however.",
      "Had a very nice stay at Richard’s place. Super close to food and some shopping on 17th ave, and free parking was a bonus! The building was quite noisy during the night, but we did not find it difficult to sleep through. Location was most important for us and this was an ideal place to book."

If those are full, there&#x2019;s a paid lot just one block away, and street parking is also available nearby.\n<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"_g5uevq\">Other things to note</span>\n<br>\nThe property is located in a lively urban area, and since it&#x2019;s an older, wood-framed building, you may occasionally hear some city sounds. We do our best to ensure a comfortable stay, and while a bit of urban ambiance is part of the downtown experience, we&#x2019;re here to help you feel right at home.\n<br>\n<br>\nWe are committed to ensuring the comfort and safety of all our guests. At this time, we are unable to accommodate pets in the suites.

It had all the amenities as promised like the washer-dryer, heating and a nice kitchen with pots, pans, coffee maker and utensils. <br/>There was not a single issue/concern throughout our month-long stay.

      "It was my first time to stay at a luxury airbnb, and I called this place my penthouse. From the mesmerizing view to spacious area, everything was perfect and very cozy. I felt very safe staying there alone with the building strict access system. I will definitely choose this airbnb if I ever visit Calgary again! Thank you for the great stay.",
      "Kyle’s place was excellent, from the beginning communication was clear and concise. The condo was in great shape and an excellent location. The View! The pictures in the ad did not do this justice, waking up and having a cup of coffee while looking at the mountains was excellent. I would highly recommend this unit to anyone",
      "Had a wonderful time in this stunning condo! It was centrally located, very spacious, and clean. Both mornings I woke up to  beautiful views of the city and air balloons over the mountains from a distance. Just steps away from pubs and restaurants, meaning I didn't have to stray too far if I didn't want to. I'd highly recommend this one, and can't wait to come back!",
      "When I booked this place, I thought it was too good to be true.  The location, view and luxurious feel was even better than the photos. I will be back and strongly recommend this place, you won’t regret it!",

      "Table was set for my girlfriend and I when we arrived. The view is magnificent yet the place still allows for privacy with use of the blinds. Hosts were always available by text if we needed anything. Would definitely stay there again.",
      "It was such a convenient place to stay in relation to the city center. The views were marvelous. We had everything we needed to feel at home. Kyle was extremely quick to reply to any message. I would recommend his place to anyone interested.",

The location was perfect and made our trip even more enjoyable. Absolutely no issues at all, we’d definitely stay here again! Highly recommend.",
      "Truly a fantastic stay. The place exceeded expectations—spotlessly clean, well cared for, and exactly like the photos. Excellent value and a convenient location. I’d definitely return!",
      "Great place with a perfect location downtown close to everything in the city. Had a couple of hiccups particularly with the AC which doesn’t seem to cool down on hot summer days but Kyle was very rapidly responsive and though we couldn’t get the temperature cooler he was very helpful.",
      "We were pleasantly surprised how spacious the living space was - windows everywhere makes the place feel grand!<br/>Location is perfect for hitting the CTrain, Calgary Tower, Core Downtown shopping.<br/>Everything about the place made us want to stay longer.",
      "All smooth! Would stay here again. Fantastic location with great restaurants and cocktail bars within super close walking distance.",
      "Kyle was an accommodating host. Very responsive. The property was very nice. Great neighborhood with lots of nice restaurants within walking distance. Will return",
      "We had such a great experience in Calgary and part of that was because of this apartment. Cozy and quiet, clean and airy. Loved the glass window wall; hot water; great location for walking to all the things including delicious neighborhood eateries, Thai massage and grocery store. Kyle’s communication was superb. I’ve already recommended to a friend who booked a stay and will certainly return. 18 min walk to the Saddledome. Go Flames!",

The bed was really comfortable and the crisp white linens were incredibly luxurious. The condo overlooked a wide swatch of the city from east to west. The views of the city were incredible. It was nice to have a spacious outdoor space on the balcony for taking it all in. The city and all its amenities were just a short and interesting walk in any direction and the downtown core was probably only about a 10 minute walk to all the restauants, entertainment and local landmarks. Li was readily available for any advise and assistance we had a need for. We had a really nice 3 night stay and would definitely check Li's condo availability the next time we travel to Calgary.",

      "Andrea’s place was absolutely beautiful, spotless, and looked exactly like the photos and description in the listing! Check-in and check-out were super easy, and Andrea was very communicative throughout the entire stay, which made everything smooth and stress-free. Thank you so much for being such a wonderful host—I would definitely stay here again!",
      "This is a perfect location. Close to shopping, sight seeing and restaurants. In the heart of Calgary. Andrea was super responsive and helpful. My planes landed early and they provided above and beyond accommodation for the trip. I cannot say enough not thank Andrea enough for that. Perfect location to get picked up for Banff tours. Thanks again",
      "Truly one of the best airbnbs I have stayed at , Andrea is such a responsive host , I booked last minute due to a cancelled flight and she went above and beyond. The apartment itself is modern , cosy and really nicely decorated. Bed and bedding super comfy! Next time I am in Calgary I would 100% rebook. Thank you Andrea for making my unexpected stay calm and cosy !",
      "5/5!! I had a wonderful stay! The host was extremely responsive, kind, and truly went above and beyond, she even let me know after checkout that I’d left my charger behind and offered to drop it off, which was so thoughtful. The place itself was beautiful with amazing scenery and an immaculate vibe. Everything was squeaky clean, overall it was such a cozy and relaxing stay. I’d definitely come back and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a peaceful getaway!",
      "I loved my stay here. Apartment is just like the photos, very well equipped and the bed is extremely comfortable. A bonus was chilling on the balcony taking in the city skyline, very special. Great location being in the heart of downtown and 17th Ave.",
      "I had an absolutely fantastic stay at this Airbnb. The place was exactly as described, spotless, it had every single amenity I needed (and then some), and the bed and bed linens were so comfortable. Check-in/out was also a breeze. I will certainly be booking again next time I visit!",
      "it's very accommodating place  to access downtown Calgary. very secure building as far as the building accommodate. one issue i have will be parking. this place don't offer parking. it's additional cost place it's a walk from open public parking to the building. it will be very nice at list one car parking coming with the place in the building parking lot",
      "I had a wonderful stay at this place! The space was clean, comfortable, and exactly as described in the listing. The location was convenient, and they was very responsive and helpful throughout my stay. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone visiting the area and would happily stay here again!",
      "I can’t say enough about our first time visiting Calgary. I knew i had to be in the heart of downtown and this was the perfect place. From the decor, space, and location, it was such a warm and cozy unit. Everything was clean, comfortable, and Andrea went over the top to ensure my wife had an amazing birthday weekend. I had requested special accommodations and she made the process easy and communicated with me so well. I will recommend this place to my family, friends, and anyone else reading this. The views from the apartment were breathtaking and I won’t hesitate to seek out this same stay my next visit here.",
      "Book this one!!! The decor is top notch and Andrea is super responsive. Booked this trip on a whim and to say we got our moneys worth for the stay is an understatement. Everything was clean and gorgeous. Highly recommend for couples and small families!",
      "I really enjoyed staying here,  I found the location lovely and communicating seamless.  I would 10/10 stay here again very very nice place,  with great view and ideal location.",
      "Loved my stay at this condo. Beautifully decorated. Well stocked. Beautiful patio.  Lots of nice restaurants near by. Quiet building.  The bed was so comfortable with the softest linens. Would absolutely stay again.  The hosts were always fast at communicating and very helpful.",
      "Absolutely loved this unit! Would come back 100%. So clean and on point. Walking distance to so much. Look forward to coming back when travelling in Calgary.",
      "Andrea’s place was great, the bed was super comfortable. Andrea helped me with a package that was going to arrive before I was, I really appreciated that. There was coffee pods, herbal tea,  sugar, oil, salt&pepper and basic condiments in the house, it was nice that we didn’t have to leave to get a coffee. The building has many Airbnb suites, in some ways it felt like a hotel (in a good way.)<br/>You are downtown Calgary so lots of great walkable options and you get a neat view of the train. That being said downtown is loud (party goers, motorcyclists etc,)  the train is loud but if you close the windows I found it a reasonable level to fall asleep to 😊 The pool isn’t huge, so if there’s already a group in there you might not feel comfortable joining them, I didn’t end up using it for this reason. Even without the pool, all of the little touches, comfort and security I would rebook Andrea’s bnb next time I’m in Calgary. Thanks! ❤️",
      "This place was a great idea. Had everything we needed for a comfortable stay. Hosts were responsive and welcoming. Looking forward to coming back.",
      "Really nice place, clean, easy access and so near of everything",

There was coffee pods, herbal tea,  sugar, oil, salt&pepper and basic condiments in the house, it was nice that we didn’t have to leave to get a coffee. The building has many Airbnb suites, in some ways it felt like a hotel (in a good way.)<br/>You are downtown Calgary so lots of great walkable options and you get a neat view of the train. That being said downtown is loud (party goers, motorcyclists etc,)  the train is loud but if you close the windows I found it a reasonable level to fall asleep to 😊 The pool isn’t huge, so if there’s already a group in there you might not feel comfortable joining them, I didn’t end up using it for this reason. Even without the pool, all of the little touches, comfort and security I would rebook Andrea’s bnb next time I’m in Calgary. Thanks! ❤️",

      "Great place with a decent location, hard to find parking and the train right beside you is an inconvenience when it goes through the city 4 times a night. However minus this our stay was great and the hosts were very friendly and responsive, left very clear details on how to check in and all about the unit! Would stay again however I would bring earplugs this time!",
      "Clean and nice. Walkable to downtown.<br/>Communication could have been better and more prompt with regard to some things brought up with a broken piece of furniture. <br/>Other than that, we would stay again and recommend the flat.",
      "Nice place; however, received a request a week and a half later for $1000 regarding a missing key fob even though we left the fob where we found it. Hosts did not contact us with questions as to where we put it just left it to their management company to send us an accusatory message with the money request. I have since found similar reviews on their other properties. Not good practice and Airbnb should look into this!",
      "Ben and Lily's place is perfectly situated right in the heart of downtown. It is modern and welcoming and very well kept. Ben and Lily were always available and easy to communicate with. I stay here for a little over 2 weeks and have nothing negative I could say about the place. Highly recommend.",
      "Very clean and modern apartment in a fabulous location. Near everything you need. Host was very helpful and responsive when i needed help. Great place. Would stay again.",
      "I have stayed at this Airbnb and other apartments in this building several times. This is my favorite Airbnb. Yes, per the other reviews, there is a noisy train at night that runs several times, but it’s not that bad. My advice would be to bring earplugs or a loud fan if loud sound bothers you at night. PLEASE DO NOT let the train keep you from staying at this place, because it’s an amazing Airbnb. It’s perfect with a washer and dryer, nice deep bathtub and powerful shower, kitchen with everything you need, dining and living area, VERY comfortable bed and pillows, and a balcony that shows a beautiful view of Downtown Calgary. It’s only a 5 to 10 minute walk to the train. There are also many restaurants and pubs nearby, including a four story mall that’s in downtown. Thank you for another pleasant experience!",
      "Lovely place, we really enjoyed our stay. Great and fast communicators, really appreciated that from Ben and Lilly! Great service. Really happy",
      "It was a very good location, barely had to drive anywhere. As a student it was nice to be in the same city but feel like you weren’t in the campus atmosphere. It was very tidy and clean, they had very good communication and were easy to reach with any questions. They made it so easy to check in and out without any hassle. Definitely recommend if you want to have an effortless experience.",
      "The place looked just like the photos. It was super clean, cozy, and had such a nice view!",
      "Great place. It was very clean and covered home necessities. Walking around the area at night was okay, but not the best. Overall I would definitely recommend it.",
      "Very clean and easy to access. Beautiful view of downtown! Would definitely go back.",
      "Listed on booking free parking however it was not. And place is smaller than I expected. Not worth the money I paid for in my opinion. <br/>Nice location and clean.",
      "Great hosts, accurate description and very responsive to questions.  The condo is exactly as described.",
      "Stayed for birthday weekend. Did not disappoint! Heaps of bars and restaurants close by walkable distance to everything!! Would 100% stay again!",
      "It was a very clean place with beautiful cityscapes. One problem we encountered was with entering the building and response/troubleshooting that could have been delivered in a more timely manner. The buzzly app that they use was not optimal for entering the airbnb and hosts had to resend the link. Not ideal. Otherwise the hosts were good at answering our questions prior to check in and the place was true to photos for the most part. Couch did have a huge tear unfortunately.",
      "A beautiful place to stay! The view is amazing, and almost everything you could need is in walking distance! Ben and Lily were very well at communicating and making sure we were more then happy with our stay!",
      "The view was beautiful, and the location was fantastic. Unfortunately, we encountered some issues during our stay. The bathroom was not clean, with hair on the bath, and the bed was extremely uncomfortable, preventing us from getting a good night's sleep. As a result, we felt sore for the next few days. Ultimately, we decided to cancel our reservation. The management was understanding and refunded the remaining nights while still charging us for the first night.",
      "Fantastic Stay in Downtown Calgary!<br/>I had an amazing stay at Ben and Lily’s apartment in downtown Calgary. The space was spotless, beautifully furnished, and had all the amenities needed for a comfortable stay. The location is perfect—within walking distance of great restaurants, shops, and public transportation. The check-in process was seamless, and Ben and Lily were incredibly responsive and accommodating. I highly recommend this place to anyone visiting Calgary and would definitely stay here again!",
      "Felt very cozy and the house was so clean. It was very close to shopping mall, restaurants etc. so very convinient. The view was awesome and the hosts are very accommodating!",
      "The apartment was decorated so beautifully and had the prettiest view of downtown Calgary. It was also very clean when we first entered. We had a wonderful time and for our next visit of city we definitely will be choosing to stay there again!",
      "Just stayed for a night but it was amazing!! The bed is so comfy too",
      "Amazing communication, beautiful view, good description of place",
      "Easy to find. Clean with  great view. Definitely recommend. Super nice host also."

Yes, per the other reviews, there is a noisy train at night that runs several times, but it’s not that bad. My advice would be to bring earplugs or a loud fan if loud sound bothers you at night. PLEASE DO NOT let the train keep you from staying at this place, because it’s an amazing Airbnb. It’s perfect with a washer and dryer, nice deep bathtub and powerful shower, kitchen with everything you need, dining and living area, VERY comfortable bed and pillows, and a balcony that shows a beautiful view of Downtown Calgary. It’s only a 5 to 10 minute walk to the train. There are also many restaurants and pubs nearby, including a four story mall that’s in downtown. Thank you for another pleasant experience!",

      "Lee has been a great host. Loved the place and the location. Only minor things which wasn't a deal breaker for me, the TV wasn't smart, the sofa bed is much more comfortable than the bed itself, and no laundry in the apartment but there is a paid one in the building. Loved to see cooking essentials in the place.",
      "Lee’s apartment is great! Very clean and comfortable. There is everything you need in there. The location is also great: in a calm and beautiful area and very close to the downtown. Lee is a very friendly host and quick responsive.<br/>Highly recommended!",
      "The location was perfect, walkable, private and quiet! With tons to do in the area. Lee was very responsive and clear. The place was clean, free of bad odor and had good vibes! Exactly as described.",
      "we really enjoyed our stay here and I have nothing but good things to say about Lee and her property. it was very clean, well stocked with anything a person might need. lots of extras in terms of bedding, toiletries, even non perishables. she even went above and beyond and left treats for my kids. she was very responsive and understanding of my very vague trip schedule because of the circumstances of my stay. I highly recommend staying here and would definitely stay again.<br/>thank-you Lee, from me and my children!! 😊",
      "For a budget stay, Lee’s place was good. Very close to restaurants, parks, downtown, etc. Lee was very helpful. <br/>Unfortunately, there was no comfortable place to sit in the apartment - the chairs, couch, and futon were all pretty uncomfortable. Also, the apartment is on the first floor and the ceiling is a bit thin, so I could hear people in the upstairs  apartment, even though they weren’t being excessively loud. I didn’t mention anything to Lee because I figured there wasn’t much she could do about it.",
      "Lee’s place was in an amazing location is Calgary, close to 17th - with so many restaurants and shops. And it is tucked just away from 17th where you can enjoy a peaceful evening. Lee is a proactive and responsive host that ensures we had the best stay possible.",
      "Great spot in Calgary! Walking distance to all the best food and drink and tucked away on a quieter street. Lee was responsive and provided a wonderful stay for me and my friends! Would recommend for anyone wanting to stay downtown Calgary on a budget.",

      "We really enjoyed our stay! The place was perfect for our weekend in Calgary—quiet, safe, and within walking distance to great restaurants. Parking was a bit tight, and we couldn’t fully open the back of our vehicle without hitting the roof, but it didn’t take away from the overall experience. Lee is an absolutely lovely host!",
      "Lee is a great communicator and very responsive host.    I wanted a downtown location to be near family and so Lee’s place suited me well. <br/>The apartment was very clean, quiet and appeared as presented in the listing.   Although the building is older - the apartment interior is newer.   The bed was comfortable, the kitchen had all I needed and Lee was clearly always available if I were to need anything else.",

Also, the apartment is on the first floor and the ceiling is a bit thin, so I could hear people in the upstairs  apartment, even though they weren’t being excessively loud.

      "even tho we were there for a single night, we enjoyed the location very much. It was easy to walk into downtown, concert/stampede area, and enjoy the vibrant food/nightlife of 17th. If the destination is a bit farther, there are scooters everywhere, and the c train station a short walk away. as for our king bed with stunning views.... let's just say we would come back without hesitation.",
      "We had a great stay. The check-in and key collection was so easy. <br/>We made our booking very last minute and were able to book, collect the key and check in within an hour. <br/>AMAZING location. Restaurants and bars literally steps away. Park for kids to play across the road. Great view of the city. Whilst we were there, there was construction near by and it was not a bother at all.<br/>We were impressed by the space and small touches like breakfast packets, cereal bars etc, it really made it easy as a family to have the best start to the day.<br/>The instruction link you receive is so well presented and easy to guide you during your stay. <br/>Communication was easy, hosts friendly and ready to help. <br/>We recommend this space for families.",
      "We were impressed and amazed at the pristine view, condition, facilities, and apartment layout. It was the best place we stayed in our travels around Canada. I would definitely recommend.",

      "We enjoyed staying at this condo. Host was very responsive,<br/>We had a small issue with one of the rooms and they had someone there asap to fix the issue. The view is amazing, beds were comfortable   <br/>We rented a parking spot in the garage and that worked well, but just remember to keep the key fob to get out of the garage then run it back up to the condo when checking out<br/>We enjoyed our stay",
      "Honestly was really worth the stay the place was pretty big with a really nice amount of space and super clean and tidy the view was perfect I definitely would recommend renting a spot from them.",
      "Great view and central to all you need.",
      "Great, clean place to stay with an amazing view. Smoothest check-in process I’ve experienced.",
      "many things were broken and not working. price was definitely too high for this experience",
      "Very beautiful apartment, tidy and full of cool views. Easy to follow instructions. Would definitely love to come back again!",
      "I had an amazing stay for my birthday. Really enjoyed the view especially at night time. Everything was perfect! Would definitely recommend.",
      "Condo is extremely rundown. Needs upkeep. Needs a paint job. They have painted small patches here and there which just makes things look worse. Smelled like smoke. Balcony had cigarette butts on the ground. Most uncomfortable beds we’ve ever slept on. Couldn’t  use the pullout couch because there were no sheets left for us. Three blankets that were all dirty. Pull out couch had food in it.  Hair in the fridge. Blinds did not close all the way. Sliding door between bedroom and living space did not budge. Because the couch could not be used, my two adult sons had to share a bed, which was unfortunate. I had booked this place for 2 nights for a reunion with our two adult sons. We only ended up staying one night and had to book a hotel for the second. Our communication was with the management company and it was fantastic. Very much appreciated. Location was fantastic. I would not recommend this rental.",
      "Great hosts, great spot for downtown. Very friendly and nice. Very detailed instructions for entrance into condo. Overall great place to stay.",
      "Good place",
      "Awesome place would definitely come back. Great hosts and the views were beautiful.",
      "Great location at a decent price. Go ahead and book without any worries.",
      "They were very responsive and great to communicate with.",
      "Great place, one of the nicest view in the Calgary.",
      "Loved the skyline ......will stay again indeed",
      "Great location the heart of the booming Victoria Park neighborhood. The views of the city are stunning, and the condo was clean and organized. As mentioned in other reviews, there is only one fob/key for the unit so for our family of 4 it was a little tricky to organize if we didn’t do everything together. For one person or a couple who do all of their activities together this wouldn’t be an issue. Great stay!",
      "I had a wonderful stay at this charming Airbnb! The place was spotless and beautifully decorated, making it feel like a true home away from home. The host was incredibly responsive and helpful. The neighborhood was peaceful and conveniently located near all the attractions we wanted to visit. I especially loved the cozy patio area for morning coffee. Highly recommend this place for anyone looking for a comfortable and enjoyable stay!",
      "Intially when we got to the airbnb, we were pleasantly surprised but we cane to realize the floors were all dirty and not mopped or swept. We had a baby with us and our baby was crawling and walking on dirty floors. We let the host know about this issue and was compensated but just feel like the floors should have been clean especially if they are charge 100 dollars in cleaning fees.",
      "An absolutely wonderful stay!. We really enjoyed the view and this place is in a great location. Walkable to everything you want to do in Beltline. And even close enough to walk to seventeenth avenue  for late night scene! So many fantastic restaurants nearby! We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would  again. Our host were courteous and answered all questions thoroughly!"

Restaurants and bars literally steps away. Park for kids to play across the road. Great view of the city. Whilst we were there, there was construction near by and it was not a bother at all.<br/>We were impressed by the space and small touches like breakfast packets, cereal bars etc, it really made it easy as a family to have the best start to the day.<br/>The instruction link you receive is so well presented and easy to guide you during your stay. <br/>Communication was easy, hosts friendly and ready to help. <br/>We recommend this space for families.",

Balcony had cigarette butts on the ground. Most uncomfortable beds we’ve ever slept on. Couldn’t  use the pullout couch because there were no sheets left for us. Three blankets that were all dirty. Pull out couch had food in it.  Hair in the fridge. Blinds did not close all the way. Sliding door between bedroom and living space did not budge. Because the couch could not be used, my two adult sons had to share a bed, which was unfortunate. I had booked this place for 2 nights for a reunion with our two adult sons. We only ended up staying one night and had to book a hotel for the second. Our communication was with the management company and it was fantastic. Very much appreciated. Location was fantastic. I would not recommend this rental.",

      "I had no major problems with the stay. The place is nice, and the location is prime. The bed is not the most comfortable. There were lots of towels, but I do feel they could include more than a single facecloth for a week long stay.<br/>My concerns happened in the booking phase. The owners asked me for a picture of my driver’s license, and my phone number. I refused to provide either, thinking they might cancel my booking. But they didn’t cancel.",
      "The mattress and sofa were a little worn out and didn’t had a great cushion, however rest of the apartment is great and view was amazing, I really had fun and host is very reachable and friendly.",
      "Had all the basics I needed. Great neighbourhood and walkable to different areas of downtown. Good experience overall.",
      "Easy to get in. Building elevators can be rather busy on Fridays I was told from some residents of the building. Probably wouldn’t be so bad but I was checking out on the first day of stampede and someone booked one of the elevators to move. Fortunately Joe and Mary were understanding and accommodating for me. The place was absolutely beautiful. We were able to catch the stampede fireworks from the balcony. Found it to get hot one of our mornings during a heat wave (32 or 33 outside before noon) but J&M provide a fallen to move air which helped tremendously. Great communication and offered creative suggestions for outings and dinners. Really felt at home here, I hope to return some time soon.",
      "The place was very spacious and had a really comfortable bed. It was very clean and had enough towels. It was quiet and well soundproofed. The shower was hot and had good water pressure. There was a fan to manage temperature, but no air conditioning. The chairs at the kitchen table were very worn and sunk-in, as was the sofa, and all the seating wasn’t very comfortable. Also, at check in, I had to carry my suitcases up the stairs for one level, because the buzzer only worked to get guests to floor 17 and the suite was on floor 18. Overall, great stay and great value, and I had good sleeps there, I would stay again.",
      "Joe and Mary’s place was the perfect stay for my time home. The place is in a great location with everything close by that you’d need. If I had any questions or concerns they were quick to respond and were always checking in and making sure my stay was comfortable and made sure I and everything I needed. I definitely 100% would book again! Thanks for making my stay great!",
      "This was a good stay, lots of restaurants around. Starbucks right across the street. Walking distance of Saddledome!",
      "Good at communicating, beautiful space, perfect for people with a busy schedule while they are in Calgary, good location.",
      "Great place for the price! Good communication throughout and very detailed instructions for check in and check out were provided. Appreciated the parking garage!<br/>However, it would benefit from some upgrades. The bed was very comfortable but the living room furnishings were in need of replacement - couch was very indented from common seating spots, carpet was stained and spotty, and kitchen chairs were very worn. The kitchen provided all of the small appliances needed for your stay, but if you like cooking your own meals, bring a frying pan (so warped that they could not be cooked in), a sharp knife and spatula/flipper. It also would have been nice to have more than only 2 towels and 1 facecloth provided for a weekend stay but there is in suite laundry so you could wash them as needed.<br/>Overall, a 4 star stay. With some changes and updates, it could be 5 star.",
      "Really good location and good value. Lots of natural light and a great view were a plus, too.",
      "Amazing place! Close to everything you need, with recommendations from Joe and Mary. Place was clean, convenient and quiet. Getting in and out was simple and convenient. They were very responsive and proactive in their messaging. Lovely stay and well worth the price! 😍👌",
      "Excellent private accommodation in downtown Calgary. Well worth the price. Easy check-in, even at a very late hour. Hosts are highly responsive and very easy to contact. Would happily stay here again - thanks Joe and Mary!",
      "Well located, easy access, parking available.",
      "Thank you for a great stay!",
      "Joe and Mary were good at communicating. Great location and nice view.",
      "Great location! Joe and Mary’s place is super spacious!",
      "as expected - thank you very much!",
      "Great location, the unit was what it was listed as. Communication was good, accommodating check out at noon.  <br/>Only thing I can suggest, instructions of check in was great but a lot of information and realizing after the pictures and unit is on 18th floor, but you need to go to the 17th floor then take the stairs upstairs. <br/>I suggest to bold that outline. It was difficult to carry all my luggage’s up two level of stairs. <br/>Other than that everything was great",
      "We had a lovely time at Joe and Mary’s place. The location was ideal as you could access 17th avenue and Stephen avenue within 10 minutes. Had everything we needed and we were able to contact the co-host easily.",
      "The apartment was incredibly spacious, the location was wonderful and had everything you could possibly need for your stay. The host was very responsive and helpful. I honestly could not have asked for a better time!",
      "Location was excellent! Check in process was strange as you had to go to different floors and take stairs, would have been nice if it was less complicated. The unit was spacious. With a few improvements it would be a great place to stay.",
      "Host understanding about my late arrival, clean accommodation with amenities.<br/>Difficulty entering the building the first time, but responsive and patient host.<br/>Very convenient indoor parking. Very safe space",
      "Great Place to stay.",
      "Joe and Mary’s place was a great deal, its worth the price, if you were lookin for a place to stay in Heart of Downtown Calgary.<br/>We stated for 4 days and from checking in, and up to check out, they had provided clear instructions. Thanks to Mary for being responsive and attentive to our needs.<br/>The place was so pleasing..it was so clean mainly the mirror-polished floor, the washroom was squeaky clean with basic bath needs present.<br/>The kitchen are equipped with basics utensils and kitchen tools you need for cooking. Also, thanks for the hi-speed internet connection coz my husband was able to worked remotely for 4days.<br/>What I loved most is the room was well lighted with daylight, it has glass-walled where you can see the serene beauty of the city. And the location is best because the coffee shops, groceries and restaurants were just a walking distant.<br/>I most guaranteed that I will book again.<br/>Thanks for your outmost assistance during our stay. ❤️"

There were lots of towels, but I do feel they could include more than a single facecloth for a week long stay.<br/>My concerns happened in the booking phase. The owners asked me for a picture of my driver’s license, and my phone number. I refused to provide either, thinking they might cancel my booking. But they didn’t cancel.",

We hope to host you again in the future!"

Probably wouldn’t be so bad but I was checking out on the first day of stampede and someone booked one of the elevators to move. Fortunately Joe and Mary were understanding and accommodating for me. The place was absolutely beautiful. We were able to catch the stampede fireworks from the balcony. Found it to get hot one of our mornings during a heat wave (32 or 33 outside before noon) but J&M provide a fallen to move air which helped tremendously. Great communication and offered creative suggestions for outings and dinners. Really felt at home here, I hope to return some time soon.",

The shower was hot and had good water pressure. There was a fan to manage temperature, but no air conditioning. The chairs at the kitchen table were very worn and sunk-in, as was the sofa, and all the seating wasn’t very comfortable. Also, at check in, I had to carry my suitcases up the stairs for one level, because the buzzer only worked to get guests to floor 17 and the suite was on floor 18. Overall, great stay and great value, and I had good sleeps there, I would stay again.",

        "review": "Great place for the price! Good communication throughout and very detailed instructions for check in and check out were provided. Appreciated the parking garage!<br/>However, it would benefit from some upgrades. The bed was very comfortable but the living room furnishings were in need of replacement - couch was very indented from common seating spots, carpet was stained and spotty, and kitchen chairs were very worn. The kitchen provided all of the small appliances needed for your stay, but if you like cooking your own meals, bring a frying pan (so warped that they could not be cooked in), a sharp knife and spatula/flipper. It also would have been nice to have more than only 2 towels and 1 facecloth provided for a weekend stay but there is in suite laundry so you could wash them as needed.<br/>Overall, a 4 star stay. With some changes and updates, it could be 5 star.",

Thanks to Mary for being responsive and attentive to our needs.<br/>The place was so pleasing..it was so clean mainly the mirror-polished floor, the washroom was squeaky clean with basic bath needs present.<br/>The kitchen are equipped with basics utensils and kitchen tools you need for cooking. Also, thanks for the hi-speed internet connection coz my husband was able to worked remotely for 4days.<br/>What I loved most is the room was well lighted with daylight, it has glass-walled where you can see the serene beauty of the city. And the location is best because the coffee shops, groceries and restaurants were just a walking distant.<br/>I most guaranteed that I will book again.<br/>Thanks for your outmost assistance during our stay. ❤️",

      "Condo was perfect for my group. Lots of space for the 4 of us and we loved how close of a walking distance it was to the block of restaurants and bars. The place was clean and had clear instructions on everything, from check-in/out to amenities.",
      "Ideal place to stay . Convenient location, perfect for everything. Clean spacious exactly as showed would stay again",
      "Big place, great value, great location and super responsive and friendly host. I highly recommend.",
      "We really enjoyed our stay at this Air BnB. Communication with the hosts was great, everything was very clear. The condo was really clean and comfortable, just like the pictures. It had everything we needed, so we were able to prepare many of our own meals which was great! The building and neighborhood were very quiet, yet close to everything. Secure onsite parking was fantastic. We would definitely stay here again!",
      "Highly recommend! The hosts were incredible and the location was amazing. Definitely would book again!",
      "This establishment offers an exceptional stay, and the host is exceptionally welcoming. I highly recommend it to everyone.",
      "Stay was great I really recommend this place. The location could not have been any better- so many things to do in the area and the parking was great. Walkability was awesome. <br/>Also the beds were so incredibly comfortable everything was clean and fantastic",
      "Fantastic location, the Air B&B was excellent and exactly as advertised! We had an amazing stay! I would highly recommend this place to anyone! Communication was amazing with the hosts, very responsive and extremely helpful!",
      "When our flight was canceled, we needed a place to stay for a couple more nights. Everything looks as advertised. The master bed was great, but bedroom 2 looks like a pullout mattress and wouldn’t be for an adult. The gym had what we needed. The only complaint was that we couldn’t change the temperature. The thermostat was as cold as it could be. We didn’t reach out for help, but just opened the window. It was easy to get to, but there are lots of steps and codes to keep track of. Overall, it worked for what we needed!",
      "Great hosts, immaculately clean, in a great location, quiet, well priced, and filled with all those bells and whistles that make an Airbnb a comfortable stay. Definitely recommend!",
      "Great location, clean and affordable.",
      "the location is very convenient and the place is peaceful. good for families.",
      "The people I spoke with were really nice and accommodating and it was a nice stay but my only complaint was the place needs some TLC like the kitchen needs a paint job and the cups and kitchen utensils are all pretty out dated and there is only 1 size of coffee cups which are really small and the bathroom has this bright orange look to it which wasn't very appealing to the eyes. Lastly when we arrived the bedroom where there is a tv in it was not cleaned I had to strip the bedding and wash it when we got there as there was 3 separate stains on the blanket. But other than that things were okay.",
      "We had a great stay.  The place is spacious and has very good amenities. It is close to supermarkets, shops, and restaurants, allowing you to have options to eat out or at home.  Something important to note is that YYC Airport is only 25 minutes away by car. <br/>They have a well-established recycling system, which is greatly appreciated.",
      "Clean and the host are very accommodating.",
      "Great location,close to downtown parks and bars",
      "Excellent place to stay and the price is very good",
      "Great location, just off 17th.  Lots of restaurants, three blocks from a major grocer and half a block from a donut shop.",
      "Super clean and communication was fast and friendly. Could have used an extra blanket. Highly recommend!",

The thermostat was as cold as it could be. We didn’t reach out for help, but just opened the window. It was easy to get to, but there are lots of steps and codes to keep track of. Overall, it worked for what we needed!",

Lastly when we arrived the bedroom where there is a tv in it was not cleaned I had to strip the bedding and wash it when we got there as there was 3 separate stains on the blanket. But other than that things were okay.",

      "Great experience staying in Calgary - the space is just as presented - you simply cannot beat those views!  The space was  very convenient for my needs while in town on business. Teresa was very responsive when I had any questions and during my trip planning regarding flexibility of arrival timing due to flights.",
      "Thank you so much.  We really enjoyed the views and comforts.  Great for walking and exploring Calgary.  Very close to great restaurants & downtown.  We loved our visit back to Calgary.",
      "Gorgeous apartment with everything you need, and some delicious snacks provided by the hosts! Outstanding location, everything you’d need within steps. Richard and Teresa were friendly and responsive.",
      "We really enjoyed our 3 nights at this Airbnb.  It’s a beautiful space, lots of light, great views, the attention to detail, well stocked, superb location, extremely walkable, underground parking. Highly recommended!",
      "Wonderful accommodation (just as the photos); super comfortable and in a great location (walkable to Stephen Street/Downtown but in a lovely local neighborhood full of bars, restaurants, coffee houses and parks). The hosts are very helpful, responsive and very organized. Five stars all around!",
      "My husband and I enjoyed our stay at The Nest.  The views are unbeatable and the space was cozy, clean, and nicely decorated. There are many restaurants within walking distance, in addition to a nice grocery store. Communication with the host was friendly and helpful, instructions were very clear on how to access the condo. We highly recommend and would stay again if we were in Calgary.",
      "My partner and I loved staying here. The condo is centrally located to downtown Calgary and easy to walk to a number of commercial districts. The view is also quite lovely, and the hosts provide very clear instructions on check in / check out.<br/>Highly recommended! Also read the guest book if you are newly visiting, there are good food recommendations in there.",
      "The location was great and the views were beautiful. However, our overall experience had a few issues. The shower wasn’t working one day, and although maintenance said a notice had gone out, we never received any communication from the hosts. When the shower was working, it wasn’t very clean. Initial entry into the unit was also a bit confusing and not the easiest to figure out. The welcome basket was a nice idea, although everything was expired. The bed is very hard, and the pillows are flat. The coffee machine was great, although it only worked about half the time we tried to use it. Overall the airbnb was not worth what we paid. If you're just looking for views and location, this is a good option but you can get a hotel for less.",
      "Richard and Teresa are exceptional hosts! Their home is just as stunning as the pictures suggest - bright, beautifully decorated, spacious, spotless, and incredibly cozy.  <br/>They went above and beyond to make us feel welcome, and their warm hospitality truly made our stay unforgettable. We’re so grateful for their efforts to ensure our comfort.  <br/>Thank you both so much!",
      "I found this to be a beauty apartment.  Lived tge decor,  location, view etc. Was even treated to someone's fireworks display that I  could easily watch. I'm not sure what the occasion was, but it was a big surprise.  <br/>Richard stayed in contact with me a couple times and was responsive when I messaged him. <br/>Thanks for sharing your place, I'll be in touch next time i need a place in Calgary.",
      "We were in Calgary for a little getaway and were very pleased with our stay at the Bird’s Nest. The views both day and night were beautiful and the space was well appointed and well equipped with the essentials. There were lots of options for places to eat within walking distance and things to do in the vicinity. We will definitely be back again if we’re in the area. Thanks again Richard and Teresa!",
      "Great conveniently located apartment <br/>Clean and no headache of taking out garbages etc. <br/>They do it all<br/>Will stay there again",
      "Loved the apartment, everything was provided for a great stay including basic cooking necessities like oil and spices. It was a bonus I enjoyed greatly. Coffee and tea was also provided and little things you might have forgotten in your packing were available in the bathroom in a just in case box. My son enjoyed colouring a page in the  beautiful colouring book provided and books to read were also at our disposal. Personally I didn’t really have time to read but that the option was there gives a little touch of home. I appreciated the parking and how close it was to the elevator when bringing up the groceries and our bags. The views were amazing and lovely way to decompress after a full day with a glass of wine and catching up to emails and all. We will definitely come back next time we come down as we didn’t have time to do everything we wanted. Thank you for making our first Airbnb experience so amazing!",
      "The space looks exactly like the photos. It is decorated very well, even my fiance complimented the way it looked inside. Definitely felt like the home. We also enjoyed seeing the mountains in the distance. Pristine location with everything in walking distance, and a free enclosed parking stall. We couldn’t hear any of our neighbors either, which was nice as some condos have thin walls.  I would definitely recommend this property, also the hosts are very friendly!",
      "We had a wonderful stay at this apartment! The space was exactly as described, the location was perfect.<br/>The host was very responsive and helpful throughout my stay, which made the experience even better. I would definitely stay here again and highly recommend it to anyone visiting the area!",
      "The most homey and well stocked Airbnb I’ve stayed in<br/>Really nice location too",
      "Great accommodations! All the amenities you need in a great location",
      "Beautiful apartment that will seduce you 😊 Great location and big point for the secure underground parking. <br/>Clean and fully equipped apartment. The bedding is very comfortable💤!! <br/>Richard is a very responsive and friendly host. <br/>Don't hesitate, the early morning light is worth the detour ☀️",
      "Very nice condo. Location is perfect.",
      "Great place, clean and comfortable; felt like home.  Would definitely recommend staying here.",
      "The place is clean, well decorated, and stocked with the essentials. I was suprised at how quiet it was, and what an amazing view! Would love to stay again sometime",
      "was a great location, it was clean and fit the description very well. Definitely recommend as it was walking distance of a lot of amenities!",
      "Great stay very nice bnb would recommend it your looking for a nice get away!",
      "Richard’s  place is a must while staying in Calgary.  It is absolutely beautiful, they have thought of everything and the location simply can’t be beat.  It is right in the middle of everything but still a quiet oasis on the inside.  I am a native Calgarian that has moved and felt right at home.  They are so responsive and made great recommendations.  I can’t wait to stay again."

        "review": "The location was great and the views were beautiful. However, our overall experience had a few issues. The shower wasn’t working one day, and although maintenance said a notice had gone out, we never received any communication from the hosts. When the shower was working, it wasn’t very clean. Initial entry into the unit was also a bit confusing and not the easiest to figure out. The welcome basket was a nice idea, although everything was expired. The bed is very hard, and the pillows are flat. The coffee machine was great, although it only worked about half the time we tried to use it. Overall the airbnb was not worth what we paid. If you're just looking for views and location, this is a good option but you can get a hotel for less.",
        "host_response": "Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback. We’re glad you enjoyed the location and views, but we’re sorry your experience fell short of expectations in some areas.<br/>We’d like to clarify a few points for future guests. The water outage during your stay was an unexpected emergency shut-off by the building, with no advance notice provided to anyone. Unfortunately, a maintenance worker incorrectly told you otherwise, and they’ve since been addressed for spreading misinformation. Once the water returned, silt in the system needed to be flushed — a normal result of emergency plumbing repairs.<br/>We know the check-in process is a little more detailed than a hotel, but it’s necessary to maintain security in the residential building. This is why we ask guests to review the instructions beforehand, and we’re happy to answer any questions before arrival.<br/>We apologize for the complimentary welcome basket containing a few items past their best before date — not expired — and we’ve made sure this won’t happen again.<br/>Regarding comfort, we’re sorry the bed and pillows weren’t to your preference. Many guests have praised the bed’s comfort, but we understand everyone has different needs. The flat pillows you found are intended for those who prefer softer support, and firmer memory foam pillows were provided in the closet (we noticed you used them).<br/>Thank you also for flagging the coffee machine — it’s likely due for a descaling, which we could have addressed had we known during your stay.<br/>Finally, we understand rates during Stampede season are higher — this is true citywide, including hotels — and we regret if that impacted your sense of value.<br/>We sincerely appreciate your feedback as it helps us improve, and we’re happy you still found some aspects of your stay enjoyable. Wishing you all the best on your future travels."

Coffee and tea was also provided and little things you might have forgotten in your packing were available in the bathroom in a just in case box. My son enjoyed colouring a page in the  beautiful colouring book provided and books to read were also at our disposal. Personally I didn’t really have time to read but that the option was there gives a little touch of home. I appreciated the parking and how close it was to the elevator when bringing up the groceries and our bags. The views were amazing and lovely way to decompress after a full day with a glass of wine and catching up to emails and all. We will definitely come back next time we come down as we didn’t have time to do everything we wanted. Thank you for making our first Airbnb experience so amazing!",

      "Alanna was very communicative both before check in and during our stay. Listing is exactly as described and pictured. Having private parking and an in unit washer/dryer was very important to us. Apartment was beautifully decorated, very clean and had a very functional layout. <br/>Great location, walkable to everything we wanted to see. Highly recommended for a stay in Calgary.",
      "Alana’s condo was very clean and well decorated. Great views of the city and walkable to many restaurants. Alana was a great host and communication was excellent. We had a bit of an issue with parking, as our rental SUV did not fit in the parking stall; however, she communicated very well with us, and we came to a mutual solution. Would highly recommend this condo for a stay in the city.",
      "Amazing place to stay when you’re in town. Easy access to a lot of local shops and restaurants. Night life is also walking distance and the streets surrounding the place felt safe. The place itself was great—beautifully decorated, clean, and cozy. Alanna really knows how to make their guests feel comfortable and feel at-home. Would definitely recommend this place. And if I’m ever in town again, would most certainly book again!",
      "Our host Alanna was wonderful. Communication was quick and easy and she made the check in and check out process smooth and simple. The place itself was great. It was very clean, beautifully decorated, and had a warm and cozy atmosphere. The location downtown was perfect, close to lots of great restaurants and things to do. We would definitely stay here again and recommend it to others.",
      "this is a really nice stay, true to the description and photos, and you will be treated to some spectacular sun rises if you are up early. Well-equipped with lots of nice touches that add comfort to the stay.",
      "Had a great stay here. Super nice, clean, and modern space in a great area. Lots to do in the area and the secure parking area was a great addition. <br/>Would highly recommend!",
      "We had a fantastic stay in Alanna's apartment last week! The place was beautifully decorated and in a great location with easy walking or C-train access to Downtown Calgary. The facilites were great, particularly the lovely well-equipped kitchen and the useful washer/dryer too. It was also great to have some nice bars and the First street market plus food court right on our doorstep. This was the perfect base for us to explore Calgary and the surrounding area, thankyou!",
      "This condo is a gem! My husband and I spent a wonderful weekend in Calgary, and this was a great place to stay! The condo has a magical city view and we were able to explore the area with ease. The condo is incredibly clean, peaceful comfortable, and we felt right at home. Alanna is a great host and communication was seamless. Thank you for sharing this beautiful condo with us!",
      "Perfect place for city visitors, with easy access to all you need - parking, walking distance to local spots. Alanna is super responsive and proactive, we love and appreciate all efforts she has put into the apartment to make it feel just like home and comfortable for travellers. Highly recommend Alanna’s place!",
      "My stay at Alanna’s place was terrific. It was clean and beautifully decorated. The kitchen had everything I needed and more and having a full spice rack was amazing. The location was awesome, I walked to restaurants, coffee shops, a beautiful park she suggested and the event I had at the BMO Centre. I will definitely stay here again.",
      "I had the pleasure to stay at this property and it is a great downtown location with lots of amenities nearby.  The space was exactly as described and very comfortable.  I would definitely rent this property again.",
      "HIGHLY recommend!!!   We will be back for sure.   It has everything you need, fantastic location, very clean and comfortable.    Loved our stay here and Alanna was great to communicate with.",
      "Alanna is a great host! Quick  to respond to messages. Very  clean condo with everything we needed. Condo is located in great location. Would definitely stay again at her lovely condo for our next visit to Calgary.",
      "Host was proactive for check in/out  and follow up. <br/>Suite was updated with all amenities. Easy access to building and local restaurants. Great location between stampede grounds and down town events for Stampede 2025.",
      "We had a wonderful stay at Alanna’s place! The apartment was spotless, cozy, and had everything we needed for a comfortable visit. The location was great — close to everything, but still quiet and peaceful. Alanna was a fantastic host: friendly, responsive, and thoughtful. Check-in was easy, and all instructions were clear.<br/>We truly felt at home and would definitely stay here again. Highly recommend this place to anyone visiting the area!<br/>Thank you so much, Alanna!",
      "This place was everything we could ask for and more. Highly recommend Alanna’s Airbnb to anyone, as the unit was amazing and she was an extremely responsive host. Will definitely stay here again next time I’m in Calgary!",
      "Alanna was really helpful throughout my stay and gave very detailed information on everything that I needed. I enjoyed staying at Alanna’s place, it was very beautiful and homely.",
      "Alanna and her place is a gem in Calgary! <br/>Beautifully designed interior, comfortable space, and has everything you’d need!<br/>She was very responsive every step of the way! It was my first time visiting Calgary and she didn’t hesitate to provide recommendations for activities and good places to eat!<br/>Good location and very walkable to whatever you may need downtown. <br/>I would 100% recommend and personally would rebook if I were to be in town again!",
      "Had an important meeting in downtown Calgary. Alanna's Apartment was a 10 minute walk from that location. We were able to just leave our vehicle in the apartment garage and walk or ride a scooter around the downtown area to check things out and get to the meeting. I don't enjoy driving in that area so this was great for us. <br/>The apartment was perfect for us for location and amenities. Price was very reasonable for a modern well equipped apartment. Would definitely stay there again if possible the next time I have business in that area.",
      "We booked this awesome condo as a mini stay-cation for myself and my maid of honour while we went wedding dress shopping during the weekend. The place was spacious, well stocked, spotless and had a very comfy bed and cozy/elevated feel. We loved all of the extra touches such as ambient lighting options everywhere, good storage, high quality bathroom products that smelled great and some snacks and drinks left for us to get through the weekend. You can tell Alanna takes immense pride in this property and the location was unbeatable if you are looking to experience great restaurants, cocktail bars and walkability. I could have spent a week staying there and I was sad when it was over. <br/>The only tricky part was even though Alanna did have great instructions for entering the unit, it was very cumbersome just based on the building and how it works the first time you arrive, but after that it was fine!",
      "Fantastic stay in a well designed, well located and clean apartment. Highly recommend!",
      "Great spot, I really recommend it. Lots of things to do around the apartment, located in a beautiful sector. The host was also really responsive and nice.",
      "The place was absolutely perfect, and the complimentary snacks were a great touch. Alanna is an amazing host!I highly recommend!",
      "The stay at Alanna’s place was amazing. It’s very clean and cute and the location is perfect for downtown!"

Would highly recommend this condo for a stay in the city.",

We loved all of the extra touches such as ambient lighting options everywhere, good storage, high quality bathroom products that smelled great and some snacks and drinks left for us to get through the weekend. You can tell Alanna takes immense pride in this property and the location was unbeatable if you are looking to experience great restaurants, cocktail bars and walkability. I could have spent a week staying there and I was sad when it was over. <br/>The only tricky part was even though Alanna did have great instructions for entering the unit, it was very cumbersome just based on the building and how it works the first time you arrive, but after that it was fine!",

      "Good flat, responsive guest, clean. Only thing, be aware that the flat has wide windows open on the building's main terrace so not ideal if you want full privacy or unobstructed views.",
      "Do not rent from these people!! Place is not clean with stains and mould. But the worst part is that the cleaners “cleaned” the unit a day before my departure, dumped all my clothes, shoes and toiletries bag in my suitcase, threw away my razor and shampoo and stole $300 that I had hiding in my toiletries bag!! Filed a report with Airbnb and the police. No help from the host and calling me a liar even though they admitted that the cleaners made a mistake with “cleaning “ the unit a day early. Absolutely furious! I asked for the name of the cleaner, so I can pass it onto the police, but they’re refusing to give it to me. Be aware!!! 11 years on Airbnb, never experienced something like this.",
      "Awesome location! So many restaurants and options close by including a Starbucks right across the street.<br/>Very responsive couple! Easy to follow instructions. The condo felt cozy and nice to have more space than a hotel room. <br/>There were some issues that have been previously discussed. I think also we would’ve liked new towels and a second key. But other than that, it had everything we wanted and we would stay again! Thank you.",

      "Great central location with acsess ti a large walk out balcony",
      "Thanks",
      "It was an amazing stay at this place. Would definitely recommend.",
      "Mary and Joe’s apartment is located in a great place, tons of local amenities including shops, pubs, restaurants, parks and more. <br/>The residence itself had a lot of broken fixtures such as toilet paper holders, closet doors, the towel hook was hanging out of the wall with screws poking out, patio door was broken off. Many of the day to day necessities couldn’t be used which was difficult over a 10 day period.",
      "It was conveniently located in the heart of downtown, making it easy to get around, with plenty of amenities nearby. The place was clean, and the detailed, friendly explanations were much appreciated!",
      "The suite was immaculate, peaceful, and felt like home. It provided  the major things we needed for a comfortable and relaxing stay. The abundant natural light from the surrounding windows was a delight, and I liked the small yard that connected to the larger rooftop garden, which was creatively designed as the roof of the parking area. (Other suits on that floor, adjacent to the yard, had a small yard connecting to that area as well). A couple of minor issues were that the window handle was broken and needed repair, and the towel rack in the bathroom was missing.",
      "This was all about LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION <br/>Large enough for 2 couples or individuals to have their own separate space and yet still feel connected to each other….. Did I say LOCATION Yet….!!!",
      "Great location. My group booked for the stampede and everything was within walking distance. However, the place itself needs a lot of maintenance work done (closet doors falling off, towel rack fallen off/holes in wall, patio door doesn’t have handle and screen was on the ground outside).",
      "The apt is in a very good location  with easy access to the train and many good restaurants within walking distance. The accommodation was comfortable and had all amenities for a short stay. The host was extremely responsive and welcoming.<br/>However this apartment needs significant maintenance work. There are numerous broken fittings including the door handle which greets you on first entering. This could be a five star accommodation however the property requires better care and attention."

But the worst part is that the cleaners “cleaned” the unit a day before my departure, dumped all my clothes, shoes and toiletries bag in my suitcase, threw away my razor and shampoo and stole $300 that I had hiding in my toiletries bag!! Filed a report with Airbnb and the police. No help from the host and calling me a liar even though they admitted that the cleaners made a mistake with “cleaning “ the unit a day early. Absolutely furious! I asked for the name of the cleaner, so I can pass it onto the police, but they’re refusing to give it to me. Be aware!!! 11 years on Airbnb, never experienced something like this.",

The abundant natural light from the surrounding windows was a delight, and I liked the small yard that connected to the larger rooftop garden, which was creatively designed as the roof of the parking area. (Other suits on that floor, adjacent to the yard, had a small yard connecting to that area as well). A couple of minor issues were that the window handle was broken and needed repair, and the towel rack in the bathroom was missing.",

      "I loved my stay! The apartment was spotless, very comfortable, and exactly as described in the listing. The location is perfect close to everything.The host was incredibly responsive and thoughtful. I would definitely stay here again!",
      "The location was excellent, with lots of great shopping and restaurants just a short walk away. The condo was very clean, and check-in was super easy. I would definitely stay again on a future trip to Calgary.",
      "Great location & walkable to everything you need in town. We liked the apartment, everything was as shown in the photos. <br/>There is air con but it’s extremely loud, so we couldn’t sleep with it on. Communication with the host could have been better but overall we enjoyed our stay.",
      "The location was perfect. A lot of pubs and restaurants for food. It was a cute little condo perfect for 1 or 2 people for a weekend away. The a/c is two portable units, which could be a bit noisy to some, but we have a fan running all night at home anyways so it didn't bother us and  just gave us the white noise. Would definitely stay again.",
      "Pros - good location, spacious, clean, well equipped, outside balcony is a bonus. <br/>Cons - the bedroom is so bright we had to wear eye masks all night every night. It's the only window in the apartment without a blind, which doesn't make sense, and has a very thin white curtain which basically does nothing. Even at night, there's a bright lamp directly outside, so it's always bright. Frustrating when having a dark place to sleep is a pretty basic requirement of accomodation. <br/>I also messaged, twice, for help or just advice on storing luggage before the flight and they just ignored my questions and instead just continued to send automated messages about checking out. Again, frustrating. Overall we would recommend despite this.",
      "Stayed at Virginias during my stay in Calgary, first time comer so didn’t know the area too well before arrival- Virginia had recommendations to all her favourite places near by which help! Condo was clean and quiet! Definitely will be using Virginia’s Airbnb next time I’m in!",
      "Virginias place was in an amazing location and very well kept and cleaned. All necessities were there like coffee, cups, shampoo, etc",
      "Great location! Other reviews nicely capture the location / condition etc<br/>Good value for money for sure",
      "Great place to stay. Location had lots of places to eat nearby. The apartment itself was as described, very clean with lots of space for two people. Highly recommend!",
      "Great stay at this place, it was nice and spacious and clean. We had a fun stay. Virginia was very accommodating and responsive to our inquiries too. 10/10",
      "Great location for us and the time we spent at the MNP arena. Nice area with lots of restaurants.",
      "Amazing stay. Host checks in with you throughout the stay to make sure everything is well and comfortable. I will definitely book again next time!",
      "Great location! Lots to do nearby in terms of restaurants. Also a short walk to the river which was a lovely walk.<br/>Fabulous to have a parking spot too!",
      "Great location. Lots of walkable places. Cute place. Super responsive. <br/>I would come back!",
      "Love the mission neighborhood!  The apartment was a little warm, a tiny bit noisy and I would have loved some face cloths.   But aside from that I would definitely stay here again!",
      "Lots to enjoy at this unbeatable location with parking! This quiet spacious condo has all the amenities and the 24/7 convenience, restaurants,  grocery are footsteps away. Balcony included!  😎",
      "Was great to be back in Mission... only a couple blocks from where I lived my first 4 years in Calgary. The place was nicely decorated, with some personal flair. Great decorating. Have already recommended it to some friends.",

It's the only window in the apartment without a blind, which doesn't make sense, and has a very thin white curtain which basically does nothing. Even at night, there's a bright lamp directly outside, so it's always bright. Frustrating when having a dark place to sleep is a pretty basic requirement of accomodation. <br/>I also messaged, twice, for help or just advice on storing luggage before the flight and they just ignored my questions and instead just continued to send automated messages about checking out. Again, frustrating. Overall we would recommend despite this.",

      "Thank you. I was impressed by very smooth check-in process. Right before I came to Calgary, my previous reservation got cancelled due to a unforseen problem. Soon after I booked Tommy's airbnb, I got a response and I could be relaxed before taking a flight to Calgary.",
      "The unit does not have window coverings. During the time in the year when the light doesn't go away until 9-10pm, it's hard to fall asleep if you have an early schedule. <br/>Cleaners didn't service the unit properly, no towels in the bathroom and the kitchen, and when I pulled some from the dryer, there were hairs on them. <br/>Kitchen is minimally equipped, in case you are planning to prepare light meals.",
      "Pros: Excellent location, clean, quiet building <br/>Cons: Drinking glasses were dirty and was not provided with any kitchen cloths to wash dishes, no face cloths or hand towels provided anywhere, missing smoke alarm, no top sheet on bed, no parking included.",
      "Had a great stay! The place was squeaky clean, great views and had everything I needed. The host had great communication and was very responsive. The location is very close to the best Calgary nightlife all in walkable distance. All in all a great stay, would love to come back.",
      "Our stay was great! The place was very clean and secure. The location is wonderful if you want to be downtown Calgary",
      "A great option for being right in the core of downtown Calgary. A bit noisy at night with the train but otherwise great.",
      "Beautiful suite to stay at if you’re in the city of Calgary for a few nights! Within walking distance to all restaurants and amenities, friendly and responsive hosts and beautiful views off the balcony would definitely recommend to anybody staying in the city, felt right at home! Will definitely be back!",
      "We left two days earlier before our check out date. Stayed only one night. Airbnb support team member John was attentive, polite, and problem solver. With all the photos and videos he requested from us, Airbnb support team came up with a solution by offering us two options. John followed all the guidelines, rules and messaged us the two options. We opted for the check out. Didn’t consider the next option at all. <br/>Thank you Airbnb support team.",
      "Our stay was very comfortable, it was what we expected . The view at night was very lovely. Would stay and recommend Tommy to others .",
      "Host is very responsive and place is very clean and in a good location will definitely book it again",
      "Very responsive host. I enjoyed each minute I stayed in the unit. Definitely recommend!",
      "The location was very noisy and the building was in a very low elevation. Should have stated this Airbnb was on the 6th floor of the building. The pool was not very nice and the \"Sky lounge\" was in the 2nd floor and not on the top floor. There was also no curtain/blinds in the living room so ppl can easily see us from the other buildings. Supplies were hastily all gathered in the broken door coat closet with some spillage - very unorganized. There where bedsheets and towels left on the dryer. Heard on top of the lung shout in the first night as well as the train can be heard in the bedroom. Bathroom only has one rag, thus, have to drag the rag near bathtub and counter space, vice versa. Invisible stains near toilet sit walls seen by UV light. In addition, there is no extra shelf to put essentials, clean clothing and stuff, and that was quite a  hassle - had to put a chair inside to put my gf's stuff on a clean surface. Price: same as the most hotels, approx. 505 Cad for 2 nights",
      "Great place   very quiet and comfortable. I highly recommend  I would stay again. Thanks for hosting me.",
      "Loved my stay at Tommy’s place. Looked like the pictures, was squeaky clean, quiet, and such a beautiful apartment! Host was very responsive and friendly. Highly recommend!",
      "Insane noise. You can hear conversations on the street from inside the apartment.<br/>Slow to respond to messages.<br/>Tried to extend before my check out and they respond after saying I can then I was working and the place was booked out as I had to re submit even though I requested extension prior to end of my term as per the RULES.<br/>Lastly, the place had construction going on the entire time in the hallway.<br/>I was there for work and it was a nightmare.",
      "The stay was fine, but the host was extremely rude. He manages multiple properties on the premises and wrongly accused me of an issue caused by another resident. After realizing his mistake, he never communicated back with me or offered an apology for the confusion and accusation. Very unprofessional.",
      "It’s a decent location however it had a train directly outside the space which was pretty loud at times. We were forced to re wash the bed sheets as they had a moldy smell to them but think it might have been the actual machine themselves.",
      "Walked from Cesars Downtown to here. Easy 15 minutes to some of the best places in Calgary. The place looks exactly like the photos, no need to worry, and is squeaky clean.",
      "Location, location, location! Close to everything downtown and some great galleries.<br/>Deep bathtub was great to have. Wish the main space windows had vertical blinds for privacy and room temperature. (Stayed in November).",
      "This was a great location. Would recommend.",
      "Nize cozy apartment neighbours and security were very welcoming, nice view beautiful home",
      "Thank you for the stay communicated and answered any questions or feedback I had about anything else that could be included the stay was very peaceful and perfect thank you so much I recommend",
      "Great location, nice apartment, no issues with noise",
      "Great service. Good views good surrounding neighborhood"

The pool was not very nice and the \"Sky lounge\" was in the 2nd floor and not on the top floor. There was also no curtain/blinds in the living room so ppl can easily see us from the other buildings. Supplies were hastily all gathered in the broken door coat closet with some spillage - very unorganized. There where bedsheets and towels left on the dryer. Heard on top of the lung shout in the first night as well as the train can be heard in the bedroom. Bathroom only has one rag, thus, have to drag the rag near bathtub and counter space, vice versa. Invisible stains near toilet sit walls seen by UV light. In addition, there is no extra shelf to put essentials, clean clothing and stuff, and that was quite a  hassle - had to put a chair inside to put my gf's stuff on a clean surface. Price: same as the most hotels, approx. 505 Cad for 2 nights",

      "Joseph was an amazing host.<br/>This is a great place to stay if you plan to be out all the time and experiencing the neighbourhood.<br/>I was here for a week-long work trip and was in mostly except for my daily meetings. The kitchen is great for bringing in food, but if you’re planning to stay long you’ll need to bring extra cooking supplies, and a coffee maker.",
      "Great location on a busy strip of 17 Ave with loads of bars and restaurants that’s bumping most nights, especially over the weekend. Keep that in mind if you are a light sleeper, there is a decent amount of noise that comes in from outside, but fans in the room can help mask most of it. Apartment itself is very simple and bare-bones in an older building which didn’t affect the stay at all.",
      "Location was great for as we were visiting at the stampede grounds . Very good bed, as for the kitchen we only had  light breakfasts during our stay .  Good spot  & restaurants very convenient.",
      "all around great place to eat and Joseph was a wonderful host. Real quick and easy access to bars and right in the heart of the city so really ideal if you’re travelling through transit. Would definitely stay again if the opportunity arises itself.",
      "Consistently great...!<br/>I am a repeat guest and keep coming back because it’s consistently great. Joseph communicates fast, the home is immaculate, and little touches make it feel easy and welcoming.<br/>Thank you, Joseph, for another great stay.",
      "Unit is quiet and is as advertised. It is close to restaurants, pubs, and coffee shops. Joseph responds quickly. He gave good recommendations for local restaurants and pubs. Would stay again.",
      "We stayed for three nights. Joseph was a fantastic host to deal with. Very responsive and accommodating. Joseph provided us with plenty of local suggestions on places to visit and eat out and was flexible when our plane was delayed and we arrived in two groups instead of one. I highly recommend staying here.",
      "Stayed here for stampede, the location is incredible right on 17th Ave so easy walking distance to the grounds as well as everything 17th has to offer. The unit was clean and comforting, and had a great AC unit in the bedroom. Will definitely stay here again!",
      "Such a convenient place to be if you want to explore down town Calgary! Will definitely be staying again for any future trips! Owner offered great recommendations and their communication was above and beyond! Super helpful and accommodating.",
      "Host is very helpful and friendly, and the unit is definitely worth the price. It’s located in a very convenient and walkable area. The main downside is that the unit isn’t too soundproof; also the bathroom doesn’t have a vent.",
      "Was right on 17th ave which is perfect for a street of pubs & patios.<br/>Had a hiccup with a parking & he responded instantly to give us a new stall number.<br/>Check in was super easy, the place was nice for a couple to stay in. AC in the room made all the difference!",
      "Awesome place to stay, no complaints. The host was always fast to respond when I had questions and were very proactive as well. A place I would definitely come back to.",
      "If you’re looking for a simple, easy and relatively affordable place to stay, this is a solid choice. The unit is almost exactly like the pictures, and its in a great location. The lack of a washer and dryer is a little bit annoying, but other than that and the slightly sticky floors, I have no complaints.",
      "for a last minute deal, and a late late check-in, Joseph  was extremely helpful.",
      "Super friendly, responsible, couple definitely in the future if it’s available for my next trip to Calgary I will be back there thank you so much .",
      "As advertised, great location, really nice restaurants just across the street, within walking distance of all things needed during stampede time",
      "The host was nice and cooperative. Truly a five‑star experience -I’d happily stay here again and recommend it to anyone visiting the area!😊",
      "Nice place, it's what it looks like in the photos, Joseph all the time attentive. I recommend this place.",
      "Joseph’s home was everything I needed for my stay in Calgary! Location was amazing being right downtown and the included parking spot was so nice. Would definitely stay here again!",
      "Joseph was quick to respond, gave great recommendations, walking distance to great restaurant’s. The apartment was clean and looked just like the pictures. Highly recommend and will stay again when back in Calgary.",
      "I really enjoyed my stay at Joseph’s place - the apartament was clean and had all needed items. Jospeh was a great hosts giving us advices where to eat and what to see, as also he was really helpful.<br/>The only problem would be some noise from the neighbors but this is not really something that the host can maintain himself as it is a apartament in a bigger building.<br/>Additionally I need to add that the bed was amazing and it was hard to leave it in the morning ;)<br/>Thank you aJoseph for a great stay! :)",
      "Excellent location. Clean unit and helpful host.",
      "I recommend this place very clean and well situated!",
      "Joseph was a great host and I had a wonderful time at his airbnb"

Keep that in mind if you are a light sleeper, there is a decent amount of noise that comes in from outside, but fans in the room can help mask most of it.

      "I really liked the apartment. The proximity to my language school was particularly important to me, but all sights, supermarkets, etc. were also easily accessible on foot.<br/>The view of the Canadian Rockies in the morning at sunrise was indescribable!<br/>The kitchen is equipped with the most necessary things, high-quality kitchen appliances and a large refrigerator complete the furnishings.<br/>The bed in the bedroom was very comfortable. My things found space in the spacious closet. The furnishings of the entire apartment were very modern and I felt comfortable right away.<br/>The apartment was clean and in a very well maintained condition.<br/>Communication with Kyle and Andrew went smoothly and I felt like they really cared about me. This made me feel at home.<br/>Thank you for having me as your guest!<br/>I would book the apartment again and again and recommend it to anyone who wants to discover Calgary."

Meine Sachen fanden im geräumigen Kleiderschrank Platz. Die Ausstattung der gesamten Wohnung war sehr modern und ich habe mich dadurch direkt wohl gefühlt.<br/>Die Wohnung war sauber und in einem sehr gepflegten Zustand.<br/>Die Kommunikation mit Kyle und Andrew verlief ohne Probleme und ich hatte das Gefühl, dass sie sich wirklich um mich gekümmert haben. Dadurch habe ich mich wie zu Hause gefühlt.<br/>Danke, dass ich euer Gast sein durfte!<br/>Ich würde die Wohnung immer wieder buchen und empfehle sie allen, die Calgary entdecken wollen.",

      "Very nice apartment . Comfortable room . The couple who lived in the apartment are lovely people and fun .\r<br/>The apartment in the city center is very convenient to get to any place .",
      "Great apartment in an excellent location. Beautiful views of downtown Calgary and a very welcoming host. Overall a wonderful stay!",
      "The location was central downtown right across from the lougheed house where we were scheduled to attend a wedding. Walking distance to several pubs and restaurants as well as stampede. Host was not quick to respond and was late for the scheduled check-in.  The private bedroom smells like an ashtray - so much that our clothes contained that smell even after we left.  The shared bathroom was a sight to see. It doesn't look like it has been tended to in months. There was brown gunk at the base of the toilet. There was black mould along the floorboard. The sink area had a thick layer of dirt and a film of white stuff. The sink drains slowly as though something is clogged.  The main area smelled like kitty litter and cat urine.  The idea of showering here was unappealing. So much that I sought out the nearest GoodLife fitness for an area to shower.  The host was kind enough to offer us wine. Although we declined because we had plans. This place is best suited for someone who goes out late and simply needs a bed to crash. "

        "review": "The location was central downtown right across from the lougheed house where we were scheduled to attend a wedding. Walking distance to several pubs and restaurants as well as stampede. Host was not quick to respond and was late for the scheduled check-in.  The private bedroom smells like an ashtray - so much that our clothes contained that smell even after we left.  The shared bathroom was a sight to see. It doesn't look like it has been tended to in months. There was brown gunk at the base of the toilet. There was black mould along the floorboard. The sink area had a thick layer of dirt and a film of white stuff. The sink drains slowly as though something is clogged.  The main area smelled like kitty litter and cat urine.  The idea of showering here was unappealing. So much that I sought out the nearest GoodLife fitness for an area to shower.  The host was kind enough to offer us wine. Although we declined because we had plans. This place is best suited for someone who goes out late and simply needs a bed to crash. ",

      "This place was great for a small group. The location is perfect and everything you could ask for when spending the night in downtown Calgary! The beds are very comfy and the house was clean. <br/>Tristan was super responsive and accommodating for our stay. There was a small problem with the sink prior to check in but we were able to come to a resolution quickly and the remainder of the stay was amazing.",
      "This was my family’s first time in Calgary and the stay was perfect. Lots of walkable spots and the location was a good drivable distance to everything. We stayed for a week and it was a nice place. <br/>Very worth for the price. The rooftop patio and parking spot is a great perk especially being downtown. <br/>Overall a great stay :)",

Tristan was quick to answer any questions we had, and the checkout requirements were reasonable - nothing worse than ending a vacation feeling like Cinderella!",
      "This was our second stay here because we had an excellent experience the first time. Outstanding location that is an easy walk to 17th ave shops and restaurants but still on a quiet part of the street with lots of green space. Host is very responsive if you have questions and proactively reached out to ensure we had everything we needed. We hope that next time we visit the city, we can stay here again! Would recommend it to anyone.",

We felt safe in the apartment and the neighbourhood. The apartment was so clean and very quiet. We never once heard a neighbour. Having access to a gym was convenient too. Tristan messaged us to make sure that we were able to get checked-in, and again the next day to make sure we had a great night. I asked him a couple questions before and during the trip and he was very responsive. I would highly recommend staying here :)",

The unit has a noise detector and it shows the noise level was less than 45 db during the night on July 10-July 11,  so this is a lie. Moreover, all Stampede activity ends at 11.30 pm.  You also should know If anybody makes a noise after 11 pm you can call police or you can just notify me and I will the rest. The parking spot matches the standard size approved  by city. My guests sometimes parks big tracks there and you are the first guest who complained on it. I am just wondering what kind of vehicle you tried to park there"

It was just like the photos and the host was attentive, quick to respond and helpful in answering any questions. Regarding the price, it was a little bit expensive for the size of the space, but worth it for the location. I would definitely recommend booking with these hosts!",

      "Had a wonderful stay. Felt right at home and was a lovely introduction to Calgary - would definitely return/recommend.",
      "Overall I had a wonderful stay! I’ve stayed in this building numerous times and it’s close to everything I love. <br/>The only two things I would change about the airbnb is to have blackout blinds in the bedroom. There are blackout ones in the living room, which I was a tad confused by. It was hard to sleep in after the sun came up. <br/>Also, I’ve never had a checkout time be 10am. It’s usually 11 or 12. So I was a bit rushed in the morning and had to go around downtown with my luggage due to a later flight.<br/>With that being said I would definitely stay here again. <br/>The bed was so big and comfortable, I was missing sugar for my coffee and Kyle had some delivered which I appreciated a lot.<br/>I’m 100% coming back and will be booking through this host for sure.<br/>Thank you!!",

I’ve stayed in this building numerous times and it’s close to everything I love. <br/>The only two things I would change about the airbnb is to have blackout blinds in the bedroom. There are blackout ones in the living room, which I was a tad confused by. It was hard to sleep in after the sun came up. <br/>Also, I’ve never had a checkout time be 10am. It’s usually 11 or 12. So I was a bit rushed in the morning and had to go around downtown with my luggage due to a later flight.<br/>With that being said I would definitely stay here again. <br/>The bed was so big and comfortable, I was missing sugar for my coffee and Kyle had some delivered which I appreciated a lot.<br/>I’m 100% coming back and will be booking through this host for sure.<br/>Thank you!!",

      "Wonderful stay! The place was exactly as described, spotlessly clean, and the host was responsive and helpful. Check-in was smooth, location was perfect for our needs, and all amenities worked great. Would absolutely stay here again and highly recommend to others. Thank you for a fantastic experience!",
      "Chloe & Jason were phenomenal! Incredibly smooth check in and very thorough PDF doc outlining everything for the condo from check in & check out to amenities and even recommended spots! The condo itself was perfect and made for a wonderful stay! Would highly recommend and will definitely be back! Thanks again!",
      "Large and comfortable apartment in Calgary.<br/>We had to book the apartment very short notice due to a cancelation we received.<br/>This was not an issue and we are very grateful for the great Organisation.<br/>The bed in the big bedroom is large and very comfortable.<br/>The view from the apartment is just amazing.<br/>We really enjoyed the stay and can only recommend.",
      "Very organized and looked exactly like the pictures. The communication was very open and available ALOT of details and instructions. Overall great stay I would stay here again. Thanks for being great Hosts Jason and Chloe.",
      "I stayed here for 5 nights a my Mom. Always a treat getting to spend time with her, and staying at Chloe and Jason’s for the bill perfectly. <br/>There’s a lot going on in the neighborhood. Good restaurants and bars, real businesses, and other residential projects. I was able to walk to my morning meetings downtown in no time. 17th Street is also just a quick walk with more bars and restaurants and even a pharmacy. <br/>The suite is generous and beautiful. It’s very well designed and the two balconies face South and East. This isn’t your typical condo project - you don’t have to leave your room to change your mind :)<br/>Chloe and Jason made sure everything was taken care of and responded inside of 10 minutes and sometimes immediately. It was very reliable communication.  <br/>Plenty of pillows and comfortable bedding to melt into after marathon days.",
      "I wanted to share my stay in this apartment. The apartment was fabulous. The booking went smooth. I give them 5/5 but I faced a scary experience with the building itself. They have two garages in the underground parking. The main one and there's another trap metal door the further you drive down. If you drive an SUV it will give a small height space. I drove through this trap door following another car infront of me with a reasonable allowance. I followed since I was close to the car and the door was fully open when I looked. As I was in the middle I heard a sound that was the metal door hitting the top of my Audi q7 shattering the top of my windshield. Thankfully I was not injured but my hope through this message is that people will be careful with the garage when they stay at this location.<br/>Thanks,<br/>Moira",
      "What a great view!! We enjoyed this condo and super easy to get around downtown",
      "Great place for the price! We enjoyed our stay and the views of both the mountains and the city skyline. Comfortable furniture as well.",
      "The place is extremely beautiful, very clean and perfect location. The view is extraordinary and we are looking forward to come back. We strongly recomand it to others",
      "We had a great time at this location. Everything was really close, and the view was unforgettable.",
      "We had a great stay at this Airbnb! The host was super friendly and very responsive throughout our stay. The unit was clean, well-maintained, and comfortably fit five people. The check-in process was very clear and smooth, and overall, we’re really happy with our experience.<br/>One suggestion for the host: the checkout instructions ask guests to pile up used towels, linens, and rags in the bedroom. While it’s understandable to help the cleaning staff identify used items, I’d personally prefer if the host’s team handled that entirely to avoid any hygiene issues—especially since guests might accidentally forget something.<br/>Also worth mentioning (as other reviews have noted), there are some homeless people around the neighborhood, but this didn’t affect our stay and is, of course, outside the host’s control.<br/>Overall, we’d definitely recommend this place and would stay again!",
      "We were honestly quite disappointed with our 2-night stay, mainly because of two things. First, when we arrived, the master bedroom wasn’t clean at all. the floor was still dirty, like it hadn’t even been swept. The towels also smelled bad and we had to wash them before using them. The sofa in the living room also had an unpleasant smell which made it uncomfortable to sit on.<br/>Second, the TV wasn’t working the whole time we were there. We were told it was already having issues and still being fixed but we feel like it should have been sorted out before our check-in. We were told multiple times that someone would come by to fix it, so we waited the whole day but no one showed up. That was really frustrating.<br/>We paid the full price expecting a relaxing stay, but instead, it ended up being stressful. Please make sure the place is fully cleaned and ready before guests arrive. The thing is, the unit itself is actually nice and the view is beautiful. It just needs be maintained well.",
      "This property was exactly what I needed during my stay in Calgary: spacious, well-equipped, and ideally located. <br/>While the check-in process may seem a bit tricky at first, the hosts have provided an incredibly detailed and clear PDF guide that makes everything smooth and straightforward. Once inside, the space far exceeded my expectations, with stunning views and thoughtful touches throughout.<br/>It's worth noting that some of the surrounding area faces social challenges, which are beyond the hosts’ control, just something to be aware of. That said, the secure parking and overall convenience of the location more than made up for it. <br/>I genuinely appreciated the care and effort the hosts put into making this a great stay.<br/>Thanks again, and hats off to the hosts for doing such a great job. Keep it up!",
      "One of the Best building in Downtown area, the best view and location",
      "Chloe and Jason were good hosts I’ll visit again.",
      "Overall, the room is spacious and clean.They responded very quickly and were very friendly.The location is also very good, and you can walk to the nearby supermarket and restaurants.<br/>The minor complaints were that there was no hair dryer, Netflix could not be watched in the designated way, there were no tissues, and the neighbors and surroundings were noisy until the middle of the night on Saturday night.<br/>But I don't have any major complaints.<br/>We have a very good place to stay.",

Always a treat getting to spend time with her, and staying at Chloe and Jason’s for the bill perfectly. <br/>There’s a lot going on in the neighborhood. Good restaurants and bars, real businesses, and other residential projects. I was able to walk to my morning meetings downtown in no time. 17th Street is also just a quick walk with more bars and restaurants and even a pharmacy. <br/>The suite is generous and beautiful. It’s very well designed and the two balconies face South and East. This isn’t your typical condo project - you don’t have to leave your room to change your mind :)<br/>Chloe and Jason made sure everything was taken care of and responded inside of 10 minutes and sometimes immediately. It was very reliable communication.  <br/>Plenty of pillows and comfortable bedding to melt into after marathon days.",

        "review": "I wanted to share my stay in this apartment. The apartment was fabulous. The booking went smooth. I give them 5/5 but I faced a scary experience with the building itself. They have two garages in the underground parking. The main one and there's another trap metal door the further you drive down. If you drive an SUV it will give a small height space. I drove through this trap door following another car infront of me with a reasonable allowance. I followed since I was close to the car and the door was fully open when I looked. As I was in the middle I heard a sound that was the metal door hitting the top of my Audi q7 shattering the top of my windshield. Thankfully I was not injured but my hope through this message is that people will be careful with the garage when they stay at this location.<br/>Thanks,<br/>Moira",

The check-in process was very clear and smooth, and overall, we’re really happy with our experience.<br/>One suggestion for the host: the checkout instructions ask guests to pile up used towels, linens, and rags in the bedroom. While it’s understandable to help the cleaning staff identify used items, I’d personally prefer if the host’s team handled that entirely to avoid any hygiene issues—especially since guests might accidentally forget something.<br/>Also worth mentioning (as other reviews have noted), there are some homeless people around the neighborhood, but this didn’t affect our stay and is, of course, outside the host’s control.<br/>Overall, we’d definitely recommend this place and would stay again!",

First, when we arrived, the master bedroom wasn’t clean at all. the floor was still dirty, like it hadn’t even been swept. The towels also smelled bad and we had to wash them before using them. The sofa in the living room also had an unpleasant smell which made it uncomfortable to sit on.<br/>Second, the TV wasn’t working the whole time we were there. We were told it was already having issues and still being fixed but we feel like it should have been sorted out before our check-in. We were told multiple times that someone would come by to fix it, so we waited the whole day but no one showed up. That was really frustrating.<br/>We paid the full price expecting a relaxing stay, but instead, it ended up being stressful. Please make sure the place is fully cleaned and ready before guests arrive. The thing is, the unit itself is actually nice and the view is beautiful. It just needs be maintained well.",

Once inside, the space far exceeded my expectations, with stunning views and thoughtful touches throughout.<br/>It's worth noting that some of the surrounding area faces social challenges, which are beyond the hosts’ control, just something to be aware of. That said, the secure parking and overall convenience of the location more than made up for it. <br/>I genuinely appreciated the care and effort the hosts put into making this a great stay.<br/>Thanks again, and hats off to the hosts for doing such a great job. Keep it up!",

      "Geoff's place was well suited for what we needed. It felt spacious and comfy, in a safe and walkable neighbourhood right downtown. I appreciated the added touch of earplugs right next to the beds! Simple and clear instructions for accessing the building. Us old folks had a bit of trouble working the remotes, but Geoff was very responsive and came over to assist. Thank you for a wonderful stay.",
      "I loved the apartment and the hosts were extremely responsive.  The apartment is 3 floors with first floor with one bedroom, bathroom with washer and dryer, plenty of closet space.  2nd floor is living room and kitchen.  3rd floor is master bedroom and bathroom.  It’s a nice, spacious apartment.  I would definitely recommend it.",
      "We had a wonderful stay in the center of Calgary! Geoff and Taylor's home was more spacious than we imagined and perfect for a day working/ interviewing from home. They were very communicative and helpful. Street parking was easy to find. The only thing to note is there are 2 flights of stairs between the 3 floors, which were easy to navigate.",
      "A great little place to stay downtown! Just a couple minute walk from some of the main streets, but still quiet at night. The hosts were very responsive and accommodating and checked in throughout our stay. All instructions were very clear and helpful which made check-in easy. Would stay here again.",
      "The property is clean and well-stocked, and the host is very responsive to our inquiries and concerns. However, we were unable to use the laundry machine because it was dirty. Moreover, we did not feel safe walking to explore downtown, as we noticed some unkempt individuals roaming and rolling around the street who appeared to be under the influence of drugs.",
      "Great stay at Geoff ! Everything is as described. The apartment was very friendly and clean. Geoff was very friendly. Easy check in and check out.<br/>Easy walk for all main attractions of downtown, shops, restaurants. <br/>You can always find people wandering in the streets nearby, but it’s the sale everywhere in downtown.<br/>Overral a great stay. I would recommend !",
      "Great communication, super easy to get into the property, easy check-out instructions, tons of great restaurants in the area, nicely remodeled primary ensuite, friendly hosts, and great value.  I would highly recommend!",
      "We enjoyed the convenience of the location and it had everything we needed for the weekend.  Price was great and pictures and the description were accurate.  I would stay again if available for future trips to Calgary.",
      "A nice central location, that is walking distance to many different places to eat and get groceries. The place was clean and the instructions provided made check in easy. Would stay again if in the area. Thanks!",
      "Decent place. Skinny three story unit with a bedroom on bottom and top floors. Top floor has A/C middle and bottom floors do not so on hot days in the afternoon could be an issue. Street parking was okay. The walk over to 17th Ave was really nice. Overall good place!",
      "We stayed with another couple at Geoff’s place for a Rotary convention. The rooms are far apart (one on the main level and one on the 3rd) so we had plenty of privacy. We didn’t need a car as Calgary is walkable and their mass transit is excellent.  Geoff is super responsive. There’s some unhomed folks in the area but that’s not unexpected for a city and the Airbnb is in a good neighborhood. I would stay here again without hesitation!!",
      "Lovely townhome which was exceptionally clean and comfortable. Convenient central location with easy access to everything. Host was very responsive to an issue that arose and dealt with it immediately. He was very friendly and helpful offering recommendations for tourist interests. Overall loved our stay and would recommend Geoff’s place to others.",
      "Great place to stay! Super clean and had all the necessities we needed. Very cozy and comfortable place. The location is great and convenient if exploring the downtown area. Will definitely come back here when I visit Calgary again in the future!",
      "The location was fantastic, close to numerous bars, restaurants, and the train station, which made getting around by public transit super convenient. The place was clean and looked exactly like the photos. We’d definitely book again!",
      "Spend two night in this great townhouse during Stampede 2025.<br/>Central location and perfect for exploring the city.<br/>Great hosts.<br/>I can definitely recommend this place if you want to live near the center of Calgary.",
      "Place was great to stay, was clean and matched the photos and description. Host communicated well and gave clear instructions and answered questions quickly. Location is great as most restaurants/venues etc are a short walk or very quick cab/uber ride away. Would stay again.",
      "Great place to stay right in the heart of the city.  Easy walking access to the city.  The place also has a bath tub which we were delighted to find after a month of camping.  Thanks Geoff!",
      "Geoff and Taylor were very great and communicative from the start. The airbnb was easy to find, check-in was easy. The place was clean, and all amenities included (except air conditioning), along with ear plugs. The ear plugs were needed as the surrounding area can get loud at night due to pubs and restaurants. Area is walkable to popular downtown and 17 Ave. Parking was a little difficult to find but we were given a parking pass so we could park on the street. If you like being within walking distance to restaurants and lots of things to do, this is the place!",
      "The place is comfortable. Mostly very clean and new.<br/>Location is convenient and walking distance to groceries, but not somewhere I’d feel comfortable as a woman after dark.<br/>Overall very handy to walk to sites in the city.",
      "The place is nice, alot of stuff close by. I will say parking on the street is very tricky. The street is very congested and not alot of parking especially if the bar nearby is busy.",
      "Geoff & Taylor’s place was perfect for our weekend in Calgary. It’s an easy walk to downtown, and the free parking was such a bonus. The home itself is bright, spacious, and spotless— plenty of room for our family of four. I also really appreciated that they don’t charge a cleaning fee, which is so generous considering they still hire cleaners who do a fabulous job. Check-in instructions were clear, noting that the front door leads to two units (one being yours) - just be sure to read them carefully so you don’t miss it like I did haha. :) Taylor and Geoff were incredibly responsive and quick to answer any questions, which made the stay even better!",
      "Geoff's place was great! I was travelling with my husband and daughter and we appreciated having the room to spread out. Each of us had either work / studying to do so having different spots to do that was helpful (desk in one bedroom, the dining room table, the comfy couch). Easy walking distance to cool restaurants on 5th and 17th. Highly recommend Milpa (amazing Mexican food and delicious cocktails / mocktails) and the Sweatered Hen (outstanding breakfast). We also went on a walk to Lindsay Park -- wish I'd had more time to explore. Geoff was really responsive with any questions we had! All in all a delightful stay! Thank you!",
      "Geoff’s place was absolutely wonderful to stay at, perfect location and very nice and responsive hosts! Could not recommend this place enough!!",
      "Geoff place was very nice and felt like home away home. I’ll be definitely coming back to stay at Geoff place. Highly recommended. Thank you."

Had a bit of trouble checking in but Jonathan was accommodating of a check-in after hours which was appreciated. Also sent lots of great recommendations for the area. Would definitely stay again!",
      "What a gem of an Airbnb! The downtown location couldn't be beat for exploring the city, and waking up to that amazing view every morning was a highlight. Beyond the great space, our host was genuinely friendly and welcoming, making the stay even more enjoyable. Would definitely book again!\"",
      "It was the perfect place and just what we needed whilst staying in Calgary. Had all the amenities we needed and the view from the apartment is just beautiful. Thank you for the pleasant stay.",
      "We had a lovely stay the views were amazing and we enjoyed watching the sunset. The space was lovely and comfortable it made a great base.",
      "great place and location was very walkable.  only complaint was a lot of noise at night between the railroad and sirens.",
      "I had such a wonderful stay at Jonathan’s 24th-story condo! The view is absolutely stunning, and the location couldn’t be better,just steps away from fantastic restaurants like Bridgette bar and sweet Loretta‘s. Having secure convenient underground parking made everything so easy.<br/>The condo itself is beautifully appointed with everything you could possibly need. It was spotlessly clean, with crisp white towels and linens that made it feel like a luxury hotel. It’s the perfect space for up to two people.<br/>The building amenities are great,the pool may be on the smaller side, but it was more than sufficient for a refreshing dip. What really stood out were the thoughtful little touches Jonathan put into the space. His collection of retro cassette tapes and the ghetto blaster added such a fun, personal vibe and put a smile on my face throughout my stay.<br/>Overall, a fantastic experience,I’d definitely recommend this condo to anyone looking for comfort, convenience, and character.",
      "Spent 10 days here.  The place was exactly as described and with the clear weather the views towards the mountains spectacular. Jonathan was easy to communicate with and was flexible around our arrival time from the airport. I would definitely look to see if this place was available on my next visit to Calgary.",
      "What a stunning condo. We stayed here for a week when we first arrived in Calgary and couldn’t be more happy. Everything is in walking distance, including grocery’s only a couple of blocks away. And the apartment, really cool decor, comfy bed, and everything you could possible need. To top it all off, Jonathan was quick to respond to any questions and amazing to deal with. Definitely check this place out if you need somewhere to stay in Calgary!",
      "We spent almost two weeks at Jonathan’s apartment in Calgary and we enjoyed our stay. The photos completely coincide with the space. It is very comfortable for two people. We enjoyed the city view, well equipped kitchen and cozy sofa and bed. The apartment desk is very useful if you are thinking of working remotely. In top of all that Jhonatan is a very attentive and ready to give you support.",
      "Jonathan is a fantastic host.  Can’t do better.  Place is spotless, beautiful views and just that ‘home away from home’ feel.<br/>Bed & bedding top notch -  slept like a baby.  Can still hear the trains, but didn’t  wake me at night and for the location, it’s hard to avoid this, it’s high enough that it’s not a bother.  Perfectly equipped.  Just can’t fault this place.  Will stay again.",
      "Beautiful condo.  Exactly as advertised.  Clean, nice view.  Convenient location with lots of amenities within walking distance.  Jonathan was a great host.",

The view is absolutely stunning, and the location couldn’t be better,just steps away from fantastic restaurants like Bridgette bar and sweet Loretta‘s. Having secure convenient underground parking made everything so easy.<br/>The condo itself is beautifully appointed with everything you could possibly need. It was spotlessly clean, with crisp white towels and linens that made it feel like a luxury hotel. It’s the perfect space for up to two people.<br/>The building amenities are great,the pool may be on the smaller side, but it was more than sufficient for a refreshing dip. What really stood out were the thoughtful little touches Jonathan put into the space. His collection of retro cassette tapes and the ghetto blaster added such a fun, personal vibe and put a smile on my face throughout my stay.<br/>Overall, a fantastic experience,I’d definitely recommend this condo to anyone looking for comfort, convenience, and character.",

      "Booked this BnB for a nice quiet gateway. The room was not so clean, had debris and dirt over the floors. The view was the only outstanding part of the apartment. We hardly got any sleep in due to the party happening. The closest was pre-broken when we got to the bnb, definitely does not match the pictures. I wouldn’t book again if I was looking for comfort. I will definitely book for the view. The communication between the host was smooth.",
      "I had a fantastic stay here. The location is amazing - clear views of the Calgary tower from all areas of the condo. <br/>The unit was clean, and communication from the hosts was very warm and near instant throughout the experience, which took a lot of stress off of the trip. <br/>Kudos to the team, I enjoyed my stay and will be back. <br/>Thanks again!",

      "Pros... there are many:<br/>Best thing about this place is the full view of the city from both the lounge and the bedroom - I couldn't get enough of it!<br/>Place is much as pictured, photos are glossier and make it seem a bit bigger/ brighter. It's still a beautiful place, even without the gloss.<br/>Check in was simple and contactless.<br/>Everything was clean<br/>Appreciated the Tim Hortons coffee pods every morning :)<br/>Nice Japanese restaurant/ bento place nearby, and a convenient walk/ ride to Stephen Avenue. <br/>Bed was very comfy, and there's loads of storage space.<br/>-Shower head - please replace asap as that one is unusable - used the bottom tap which was frustrating.<br/>- Soap dispenser - pump did not work throughout my stay<br/>- Some sockets in bedroom don't work<br/>- Not a major issue for me, but  bedroom closet door is broken and leans on a wall<br/>-Communication was prompt, except near check-out; requested delayed check out and had to follow up next day. Declined, so had to leave sharpish!",

It's still a beautiful place, even without the gloss.<br/>Check in was simple and contactless.<br/>Everything was clean<br/>Appreciated the Tim Hortons coffee pods every morning :)<br/>Nice Japanese restaurant/ bento place nearby, and a convenient walk/ ride to Stephen Avenue. <br/>Bed was very comfy, and there's loads of storage space.<br/>-Shower head - please replace asap as that one is unusable - used the bottom tap which was frustrating.<br/>- Soap dispenser - pump did not work throughout my stay<br/>- Some sockets in bedroom don't work<br/>- Not a major issue for me, but  bedroom closet door is broken and leans on a wall<br/>-Communication was prompt, except near check-out; requested delayed check out and had to follow up next day.

      "This was an absolutely beautiful place to stay with amazing views of the city from floor-to-ceiling windows in every room. The furniture was comfortable and thoughtfully laid out to maximize the space. <br/>Eos was easy to reach out to for any questions. <br/>We will definitely stay here again in the future.",
      "Stayed at Eos’s place in Calgary and had a great experience.  Communication was great, it was exactly as listed and had amazing views.  The cocktail bar downstairs in the building was awesome too.  5-stars!!",
      "Would definitely stay again at this condo! Great location and the owner was very responsive and accommodating.Close to Stampede Park and Stephen Ave. , which was nice. Some snacks and beverages provided at check in, plus a gift card to a restaurant across the street…nice touch! Thanks for everything!",
      "My wife and I had the pleasure to see Calgary for the first time while visiting family who had recently moved there.<br/>Fairly new with Air BNB however, we are getting the hang of it. <br/>The condo unit was perfect, we felt right at home.<br/>Clean, quiet, secure, great views and fantastic location. <br/>Our host was quick to reply to any questions or concerns.<br/>As we plan on travelling to Calgary more often, this place will be our first choice if available.",
      "A beautiful apartment overlooking the City on a high floor exactly as pictured in their listing.  Hosts were wonderful and communicated immediately when we had a question.  Highly recommend while staying in Calgary.  Great location.",
      "I loved this AirBnb accommodation. It is a gorgeous, light-filled space with beautiful furnishings and many thoughtful amenities like bottled water, chips, and a generous Starbucks gift card, and also body lotion and a blow dryer. The mattress in the main bedroom was super comfortable for me, as were the pillows (I tend to be very fussy). Honestly, I felt so comfortable and well, I didn't want to leave. As for the location, there's so much to get to within walking distance, including an excellent food court right across the street. Thank you so much. I felt like a queen.",
      "Perfect location, walking distance to great restaurants and cafes, supermarket and liquor stores just downstairs. The place is well appointed, clean and very comfortable. I would recommend and book again.",
      "Eos was a great host - very responsive and was flexible with the check in time when we needed it! Additionally, the complimentary snacks and the other additional supplies were much appreciated. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and if I come back to Calgary again, I’d stay again. 10/10 recommend!",

It has a great view of the city, is modern, neat and clean and very comfortable (the beds are very comfortable). Amenities are plenty and well thought out. Same time next  year, we'll be back.",
      "We loved our stay at this condo - beautiful space, great location, very responsive and friendly host. The layout, furnishings and decor are a step above. The location is central with great restaurants, pubs, and parks close by. As well, walkable to both downtown and 17th avenue. It was perfect for our girl's getaway. Will definitely book again! Thank-you!",
      "We absolutely enjoyed the condo and especially the views. <br/>The unit is well decorated and the host provides little extras for the guests, snacks, water, laundry detergent, etc.<br/>It was perfect for a short stay and would be great for a longer stay too.<br/>Host was responded quickly and all the instructions were very clear.<br/>Highly recommend if you enjoy downtown life.",
      "Place was gorgeous, stunning views, amenities galore. Only small nitpick is having to park and go get the fob, then having to do the same when leaving. Also one elevator was down one of the days and it made it incredibly annoying to get in and out. Otherwise, it was exactly as listed, EOS was fantastic with communication and gave very clear instructions.",
      "EOS was a wonderful host.. super quick response times and always available when I needed to get a hold of them! Checking in and checking out was simple and had easy instructions. The location was perfect, super close to tons of restaurants, bars, grocery stores, etc. The apartment unit itself was beautiful and clean.

      "Kelli and Jiad were incredibly accommodating, quick to respond and super friendly. Very easy to work with and the apartment was clean, convenient and exactly what I was looking for. An absolute pleasure to stay here and I’ll definitely be back!",
      "The space is very clean, the building felt safe, and everything is as described. There were plenty of towels and even full ice cube trays in the fridge. Jiad is very responsive and accommodated an earlier check-out time for my early morning flight. I had a wonderful stay, would highly recommend.",
      "Jiad was a great host and very quick to respond. The neighbourhood felt safe and was a very short walk to the C Train as well as many shops and restaurants! I would definitely recommend his place and would stay here again in the future!",
      "We had an amazing stay at Jiad's place. Everything was smooth since the beginning, and he was very accomodating to our requests. He was very responsive to questions, and often checked up on us during the stay. The location was perfect, close to many restaurants, supermarkets and dowtown. It was really easy to go anywhere because it was really close to the train station as well. All in all we have an amazing stay!",
      "Thank you Jiad for the great stay! We appreciated how responsive you were and how you were happy to help resolve any issues we encountered. See you next time!",
      "Location great <br/>Nearby metro, just behind the building<br/>Nearby everything: banks, government offices & very nice park. <br/>Quite area and clean building",
      "We had a great stay at Jiad’s place! The apartment was clean, cozy, and just as described. Perfect location — close to downtown attractions, restaurants, and the C-Train. An underground parking spot is available in the building. It can get a bit noisy at night from the train and yard, so light sleepers take note. Overall, I would highly recommend this place and would stay again.",
      "We had a great stay, the bed was comfy and easy to walk around the area!",
      "This condo was right in the centre of Calgary so good for doing things in the city. A dedicated parking space was a bonus for a city centre location",
      "Jiad was an excellent host! Very helpful and prompt responses. The apartment was clean and welcoming. He was also flexible with our checkout process. Great value!",
      "perfect location. small place but has everything. dusty but with having the windows open because of the hot weather that's to be expected. would definitely go back",
      "We stayed at Jiad's place because we needed a location close to Dickens - this was perfect, a 5-minute walk. The check-in was very easy with the liquor store holding the keys. If you need to leave before 9am on check out, this place might be an issue - you have to drop the keys off at the liquor store when it opens. For us, it was not a problem. The unit had everything we needed and looked like the photos. The bed was comfy. There is an issue with the pull-out sofa at the moment but we did mention to the host, as we had a 3rd person in the apartment with us. The host was very responsive and helpful. We had a couple questions regarding the check-in but he responded right away and got in the unit quickly. Overall, I would stay here again! Thanks, Jiad for having us.",
      "Jiad’s place is comfortable and well-equipped. It’s conveniently close to the station, making travel easy, and it offered everything we needed for daily life. We had a great time staying here and would definitely recommend it to others!",
      "Jiad’s place is well located and clean. I stayed for a month and I had a great stay. There’s everything you need and the host is super easy to communicate with. The check in was smooth and easy to do. Recommend staying at Jiad’s place",
      "It was a nice place to stay. Thanks to Jiad!",

If you need to leave before 9am on check out, this place might be an issue - you have to drop the keys off at the liquor store when it opens. For us, it was not a problem. The unit had everything we needed and looked like the photos. The bed was comfy. There is an issue with the pull-out sofa at the moment but we did mention to the host, as we had a 3rd person in the apartment with us. The host was very responsive and helpful. We had a couple questions regarding the check-in but he responded right away and got in the unit quickly. Overall, I would stay here again! Thanks, Jiad for having us.",

      "Great location in the heart of downtown, with lots of food options and the c train stop nearby. However, cleanliness can be improved. The bedsheets for the bunk bed had hair and didn’t smell great. The queen bed didn’t have this issue though. We also didn’t have enough towels prepared. Nonetheless, hosts were responsive and delivered new pillow cases and towels the next morning. I’m sure the hosts will work with the cleaning team on this feedback, and it will be a great stay for others next time.",
      "Great location and really good amenities! smooth communication and self check-in instructions were clear. Beautiful balcony views. Close to Peace bridge and other downtown activities.",
      "Great home to stay at if you're taking a trip to Calgary. This is probably the best location you could find if you're wanting to have a walkable experience in downtown.<br/>Chloe & Jason were great hosts, very descriptive of everything you needed to know when it came to staying at their place.",
      "A great rental in a great location with comfortable beds, fantastic views, and enough room for our family of 4. Check-in late in the evening was a bit more work than expected but that was more a mind haze product of long x-continent delayed flight than insufficient instructions. Would highly recommend and would happily stay again. Chloe and Jason were also very responsive and proactive hosts.",
      "Views are great, clean and uncluttered. Had everything we needed for a basic 2 night stay. The beds and sheets were extremely comfy. We didn’t walk much but there were two great coffee shops less than a block away and Safeway was a 5 mins walk. Hosts were very detailed with all instructions and responsive and friendly. Would recommend!",
      "I had such a great experience staying at Chloe and Jason's Airbnb. The place was exactly as described! Clean, cozy, and thoughtfully decorated. Check-in was super easy, and the host communicated with clear instructions.<br/>The location was perfect, as we wanted to be in downtown. The little touches like checking in on us and parking recommendations for those who are coming with more than one vehicle, made it feel extra welcoming! The bed was comfortable, everything worked perfectly (Wi-Fi, kitchen appliances, etc.), and me and my friends felt safe the entire time. I would absolutely stay here again and recommend it to anyone visiting Calgary. :)",
      "Unit was as described, clean and good location. Owners were responsive. No complaints and would recommend to others. It was a bit expensive but with it being Stampede weekend I think it was consistent with market pricing.",
      "I really enjoyed my stay at Chloe and Jason’s apartment. The location is perfect for anyone who is looking to explore Calgary’s downtown area. The view of the Calgary tower was spectacular in the evening!",
      "We enjoyed the place very much. Everything was clean and the owners responded friendly and quickly. Downtown, restaurants and stores all in walking distance. Uber rides were availabe within minutes. We had a great time in Clagary. Thank you for having us.",
      "This was a great place to stay at. The owners were super professional and accommodating. They answered all of the questions we had! I am considering booking with them again in the future!",
      "A beautiful home in a great location, hosts communicated well throughout the stay and made check in and out as easy as possible! Highly recommended!",
      "The views of Calgary were lovely. This was a convenient, comfortable spot. Somewhat smaller than anticipated,  but fine for a short stay.",
      "We had a great time in the apartment. The view ist absolutely stunning and the location is perfect!",
      "Condo was just as described. Great beds and linens. Communication was great and instructions were very detailed.",
      "The location was perfect and the views were great as well. They accommodated us and responded quickly! <br/>The only comment I would make is we pay for cleaning fees however the dishes were left in the dishwasher (which is what you are asked to do before you leave) therefore the cleaners didn’t even look at them and the majority of the dishes didn’t clean well.  And all the garbages just had the garbage bag hanging on the side of the them. For what you pay for cleaning fees you would think those things would be taken care of.<br/>Other than that everything was as pictured and the hosts were very kind.",
      "Exactly what it said on the tin! Everything was perfectly explained to make checking in as easy as possible and when got into the flat it was nothing short of perfect. Unfortunately we were only there for an evening but it is the perfect place to call home if staying for a longer trip, with so much space and amenities it is definitely one of the best places to stay!",
      "I had a great stay! The location was excellent, with plenty of walkable options nearby, which made getting around very convenient. The hosts were very accommodating and went above and beyond by allowing an early check-in and late check-out, which made my trip much smoother. The overall experience was positive, and I’d recommend this place to anyone visiting the area!",
      "Jason and Chloe were very helpful hosts. Their condo is in the perfect place that allows you to be maneuverable throughout the city. This was an awesome place to stay, my only negative throughout my stay which wasn’t a big deal was the lack of some supplies and their vacuum not working. Other than that, they were great.",
      "Wonderful spot to stay, location was great and views incredible.",
      "It was decent overall things could have been better with check in and response time",
      "Very nice view from the apartment and satisfied with all the amenities provided.",
      "Amazing place!! We had a very comfortable stay here. Thank you for everything!",
      "Very nice place, with everything we needed and a great location. Would definitely stay again!",
      "We truly enjoyed our stay. It had such a great view and easy to commute around city, easy to check in and out as well. Jason was also very responsive too."

The bedsheets for the bunk bed had hair and didn’t smell great. The queen bed didn’t have this issue though. We also didn’t have enough towels prepared. Nonetheless, hosts were responsive and delivered new pillow cases and towels the next morning. I’m sure the hosts will work with the cleaning team on this feedback, and it will be a great stay for others next time.",

Check-in was super easy, and the host communicated with clear instructions.<br/>The location was perfect, as we wanted to be in downtown. The little touches like checking in on us and parking recommendations for those who are coming with more than one vehicle, made it feel extra welcoming! The bed was comfortable, everything worked perfectly (Wi-Fi, kitchen appliances, etc.), and me and my friends felt safe the entire time. I would absolutely stay here again and recommend it to anyone visiting Calgary. :)",

And all the garbages just had the garbage bag hanging on the side of the them.

      "I had a great stay, Richard was very fast to respond to me. It is a great space and has lots of restaurants around. I had an event at the BMO Centre and it was an easy walk. I would stay again",
      "Richard was a very responsive and helpful host! The place was nice and very close to downtown and all public transit. Would definitely stay again if needing to go back into the city.",
      "Comfortable stay and location was in proximity to many things. Only thing is, it does get noisy at night sometimes. Thin walls and some activity on going in outside. Overall worth the money.",
      "Great clean spacious spot just minutes from 17th Ave. Richard was really helpful when we left a couple of things in the apartment after check out and we were glad we booked for our return leg - definitely recommend.",
      "A lovely stay at Richard’s property.<br/>It had everything we needed, and was super spacious.<br/>A 20 minute walk from Downtown Calgary and there was loads of bits in the immediate vicinity too.<br/>Would recommend!",
      "Richard was helpful and responsive to issues that arose concerning excessive noise at night and lack of cleanliness. Unfortunately the issue was partially outside his control. I was unable to sleep well which negatively impacted my trip.",
      "Richard’s place was a prime location for a short stay to explore the city. It’s a close walk to many restaurants, bars, and coffee shops on 17th Ave and an easy stroll to the core of downtown. Of course, with it being in the heart of the city, you’ll hear noise throughout the night so bring ear plugs if you are a light sleeper. <br/>Place was overall in good shape but could use some sweeping in the kitchen. Bed was also very squeaky with any small movement. Overall worth the stay.",
      "Richard was a truly exceptional host—communicative, helpful, and professional from start to finish. While staying downtown came with a bit of city noise (as expected), Richard made everything else seamless. His prompt responses and genuine care really stood out. I felt well taken care of and would absolutely rent from him again anytime. Highly recommend!",
      "Great location, walking distance to everything you need. Richard was very proactive in sharing information and helpful in providing an early check in. Couldn’t ask for a better host. There is noise from a nearby bar that has loud music, but given it was during stampede, it didn’t bother us as it ended around midnight every night. The building is definitely older, but it has everything you need for a comfortable stay.",
      "Clean, easy self check-in, and responsive host. Steps from 17th Ave’s bars and restaurants. The only downside is the view of a backyard with garbage bins and people drawn to somewhat shady surroundings. At night, we could hear noise from the restaurants and bars, but it wasn’t a big problem since we came back late from exploring. However, one morning a generator—or something similar—turned on, and the noise was awful for about half an hour.",
      "Richards place was in a great location, easily walkable to restaurants and shops nearby. We were working remote here for a few days and there was enough space for two people to work comfortably.",
      "Extremely comfortable stay. Richard was very helpful and always responded back in a timely manner. Located in a prime location in the city. Definitely recommend if your looking for a place to stay downtown Calgary",
      "very central location during stampede.  lots of food places & bars nearby. had a great breakfast around the corner, walking distance. next door to a good bar(some noise but it stops around 1230 or 1ish, but it was during stampede week so its expected). cool lil spot to stay",
      "Thanks a lot. The location is excellent, and the place itself is nice and cozy. However, it is quite noisy. There was a street fight around 4 a.m. that woke us up, and aside from that, the general noise level is high due to the area.",
      "Great Location .Easiest access imaginable .Responsive host gave me late Check out the place was spotless 10/10 would stay again . it was a little pricey being right before the start of Stampede but the place didn't dissapoint",
      "Richard was very easy to book with, he was very friendly and cooperative. The location was amazing, right next to the all the main bar and restaurants in Calgary 17 ave. I would highly recommended staying here for a city stay.",
      "Clean apartment. Location has walkable restaurants around it. But be warned can get noisy. No AC in units, so if you have to open window it will be LOUD and hard to sleep.",
      "Very convenient location on the edge of downtown. Walkable distance to restaurants, markets, coffee shops, transportation, parks and gyms. <br/>Richard was extremely helpful and very quick to respond.",
      "Place was cute and clean! Perfect location for anything on 17th ave or at the stampede grounds! Great stay.",
      "Amazing place, we had a lot of fun would recommend this place for the price point and ideal location",
      "It was an amazing experience. Richard always communicates and encourages you to let him know if you need anything.",
      "Clean place, great location, great communication. We’re happy with our stay in Calgary. Thanks so much!",
      "You will find a very spacious and cozy loft with a fully equipped kitchen and a full entertainment system for your streaming service. It is roughly 20 Min away from the Stampede and 30 Min away from Prince's Island Park so you can take long walks which is nice. As I understand, homeless people are a growing issue in Calgary. It is not to blame on the location, which is perfect, nor on the host who seems very friendly - but be aware that you will find them in the neighborhood. The floors in the building and the parking lot are under video surveillance and the door lock is changed frequently. So overall we felt save and we can recommend this loft.",
      "It was exactly what we needed for the time we were there. We were able to comfortably leave our vehicle parked for the whole weekend and walk every where we needed to go. It was a tidy little place that served for the purposes we needed. We will contact Richard again when we come in for the Expo next year! Thanks Richard!<br/>Evan"

Of course, with it being in the heart of the city, you’ll hear noise throughout the night so bring ear plugs if you are a light sleeper. <br/>Place was overall in good shape but could use some sweeping in the kitchen.

I’m sorry to hear noise was an issue—your stay happened to fall during the Calgary Stampede, which is the city’s busiest time of year with lots of events and late-night activity. We understand it’s not ideal for lighter sleepers but its only 10 days in July. Appreciate you staying with us and hope you enjoyed the rest of your trip!"

It is roughly 20 Min away from the Stampede and 30 Min away from Prince's Island Park so you can take long walks which is nice. As I understand, homeless people are a growing issue in Calgary. It is not to blame on the location, which is perfect, nor on the host who seems very friendly - but be aware that you will find them in the neighborhood. The floors in the building and the parking lot are under video surveillance and the door lock is changed frequently. So overall we felt save and we can recommend this loft.",

      "Bev’s place was an amazing place to stay for 4 days. Although the time was short, Bev was an extremely kind and accommodating host. Both the Check-In and Check-Out were straightforward, and the amenities were all there as listed. The AC was tiny but powerful so had no problems with the heat of the summer. The location itself is seated by some nice cafes and restaurants, and it was only a quick walk down to 17th Ave, so we had a really nice time walking through there or scootering. The bath and bed are both quite spacious, for two people this is the perfect size for a short stay! Thanks very much to Bev as well, she was a wonderful host. Would definitely stay here again!",

Both the Check-In and Check-Out were straightforward, and the amenities were all there as listed. The AC was tiny but powerful so had no problems with the heat of the summer. The location itself is seated by some nice cafes and restaurants, and it was only a quick walk down to 17th Ave, so we had a really nice time walking through there or scootering. The bath and bed are both quite spacious, for two people this is the perfect size for a short stay! Thanks very much to Bev as well, she was a wonderful host. Would definitely stay here again!",

      "I’m a local Calgarian and stayed here for a month. The location was great — walkable to everything I love about this city. I didn’t hear any noise from neighbouring units through the walls or ceiling during my stay. For anyone who’s noise-sensitive, you can hear some street noise and trains, but earplugs helped. The building felt safe, and there’s a security guard on site. The kitchen had everything I needed to cook meals, and this was the cleanest Airbnb I’ve ever stayed in. I would love to live in this building and would definitely stay here again.",
      "I loved this place and will definitely be back!<br/>The host was fantastic, everything was clean, and access was super easy. Having parking available — especially in downtown — was a huge plus.<br/>I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a comfortable and convenient stay!",
      "very responsive host and large, clean suite. suite well stocked. location being right downtown was not ideal for families with young kids, not alot of activities/parks for young kids. the pool was enjoyed by the kids.",
      "A beautiful, spacious and conveniently located condo. The gym and pool are nice additions and the condo is very well equipped with everything you could<br/>need for a comfortable stay.",
      "I used to live in Calgary and this is one of the nicest, cleanest, and perfect bnb's / apartment I have ever stayed at in YYC! From the 2 bedrooms, to the huge balcony, pristine kitchen with all needed appliances and utensils, washer/dryer, hair dryer, 2 bathrooms, and overall extremely luxury feeling! I felt very safe with the 24/7 concierge. The neighbourhood itself felt very safe and friendly located conveniently downtown. Overall I cannot recommend this place more. If you desire a luxury, cozy home feeling, and want to experience there DT life of Calgary this is the place to book! Will definitely be back and cannot wait to book again! To also add, the hosts were extremely accommodating and allowed me to check in early, thank you both again for a great stay in Calgary!",
      "Extremely easy check in. Michelle was more than flexible with our late arrival time. Would definitely stay here again.",
      "This was our second time staying here.  We really enjoy the area, lots of things to do, good restaurants and shopping all within easy walking distance.  The apartment was very clean as before and well stocked with all the basics.  We enjoyed the large balcony and large windows with great views.  Will stay again next time we’re in Calgary.",
      "We had a wonderful time staying at Michelle’s for Stampede. The condo was in a great location, spacious and matched the listing perfectly. I would absolutely book again!",
      "Very central within downtown. Michelle & Mo were super responsive Hosts. Home was beautiful, modern and clean. Would recommend and stay here again!",
      "Very nice place, great location downtown close to all the restaurants and pubs. So much to do, Uber’s are always around and scooters as well.",
      "Great location, just parked the car & walked everywhere.  We were pleasantly surprised by the items in the kitchen-equipment & some basic items for use.",
      "Wonderful stay, the apartment was beautiful, very well kept with thoughtful additions Thankyou",
      "Michelle and Mo were fantastic—very responsive and attentive and helpful! The apartment was clean, well stocked, and in a great location!",
      "Accommodations were ideal for us. Location was perfect and we could walk pretty much everywhere. The unit is well stocked with essentials and more, and whatever was lacking was replenished pretty much immediately once the host was notified. The only thing not up to par was the gym downstairs- the bike was not rideable as the pedal crank was broken, dumbbells were minimal, even the barbell plates were unevenly numbered (??) and we couldn’t open the window for fresh air. Michelle had better weights and bike in the unit itself!<br/>I would definitely return the next time I’m in Calgary!",
      "Michelle’s place was pristine, beautiful and thoughtfully appointed. Great view and lot’s of sunshine. Aesthetically decorated home.A lot of care had been taken to make the guest feel right at home. We easily found everything that we needed on our holiday.",
      "The floor to ceiling windows were great, wonderful views of the city from main room and both bedrooms.   Location was only a few blocks from the +15 and easy walking to restaurants and shopping.  Host was helpful and quick to respond to messages.  Would definitely stay again when in Calgary.",
      "Great space have stayed before and will stay again. Place is immaculate, highly recommend",
      "Enjoyed our stay here. Building and suite were great, very clean and quiet.",
      "Great location, clean, exactly as advertised with well appointed kitchen.",
      "close to the places I wanted to visit. Good security doors & elevator",
      "Nice place. Quick response",
      "A beautiful place , we really enjoyed it",
      "It was really nice to stay here.",
      "I had originally booked a different Airbnb who canceled my reservation on the day of check in. I was panicking trying to find another place as I had just arrived in a new country, but Michelle and Mo thankfully accepted my late reservation without hesitation and immediately sent over the check in instructions. They were friendly, responsive, and had such a beautiful place! <br/>We had on site parking included, but it was also walking distance to the downtown areas. The inside was spotless and had all appliances we could have needed. There were also emergency instructions listed throughout the place if needed. The view from the balcony was beautiful. So incredibly grateful for Michelle and Mo! Would definitely return and recommend to future travelers!"

I didn’t hear any noise from neighbouring units through the walls or ceiling during my stay. For anyone who’s noise-sensitive, you can hear some street noise and trains, but earplugs helped. The building felt safe, and there’s a security guard on site. The kitchen had everything I needed to cook meals, and this was the cleanest Airbnb I’ve ever stayed in. I would love to live in this building and would definitely stay here again.",

From the 2 bedrooms, to the huge balcony, pristine kitchen with all needed appliances and utensils, washer/dryer, hair dryer, 2 bathrooms, and overall extremely luxury feeling! I felt very safe with the 24/7 concierge. The neighbourhood itself felt very safe and friendly located conveniently downtown. Overall I cannot recommend this place more. If you desire a luxury, cozy home feeling, and want to experience there DT life of Calgary this is the place to book! Will definitely be back and cannot wait to book again! To also add, the hosts were extremely accommodating and allowed me to check in early, thank you both again for a great stay in Calgary!",

The unit is well stocked with essentials and more, and whatever was lacking was replenished pretty much immediately once the host was notified. The only thing not up to par was the gym downstairs- the bike was not rideable as the pedal crank was broken, dumbbells were minimal, even the barbell plates were unevenly numbered (??) and we couldn’t open the window for fresh air. Michelle had better weights and bike in the unit itself!<br/>I would definitely return the next time I’m in Calgary!",

I was panicking trying to find another place as I had just arrived in a new country, but Michelle and Mo thankfully accepted my late reservation without hesitation and immediately sent over the check in instructions. They were friendly, responsive, and had such a beautiful place! <br/>We had on site parking included, but it was also walking distance to the downtown areas. The inside was spotless and had all appliances we could have needed. There were also emergency instructions listed throughout the place if needed. The view from the balcony was beautiful. So incredibly grateful for Michelle and Mo! Would definitely return and recommend to future travelers!",

      "We were very comfortable at Rui's place, staying a couple of nights. The place is set up well for 2 couples. The place is spotlessly clean, good location with easy access, and private. The beds are very comfortable. We liked the labels on the cupboards, easy to find everything! Rui is very responsive and easy to communicate with. I highly recommend Rui's apartment!",
      "Everything was as pictured. Great amount of space for two women going to a friends wedding- seperate bathrooms to get ready was a bonus. Very detailed house manual and the kitchen has everything you need.<br/>The place was spotless when we arrived. The area is very convenient for driving around Calgary and getting to the airport and Banff. Thankful for the parking spot for our rental car. Lots of grocery stores nearby. <br/>Would stay again!",
      "Rae's place is simply amazing, in a nice area and the communication was great, we could leave our suitcases way before the check-in because of some flight cancellation issues and that was a life changer for us travelling with a child. the apartment is beautifully decorated and is ultra clean, wow. We loved it thank you again for an incredible stay.",
      "Very clean and quiet 2 bed 2 bath condo that was perfect for our holiday. Very nice layout and the place was spotless when we arrived. Could not have asked for a better experience.",
      "Felt right at home.  It's the little extras that made the difference - well-stocked kitchen, complimentary snacks, well-stocked toiletries, laundry, and cleaning supplies, back-up AC.",
      "We loved our stay! Rae gave clear instructions (with pictures!) that made it easy to locate and get inside. Cupboards were clearly labeled so using the kitchen was a breeze - no checking all the drawers just to find a spoon. It was also well stocked.<br/>We appreciated how clean Rae's apartment was! Spotless and comfortable, we enjoyed our stay and would stay again.<br/>Rae was easy to communicate with and responded quickly. Thank you for a great experience, Rae!",
      "Overall I think Rui’s place was the best place among all the four different Airbnb places that we stayed in Calgary. It’s easy to check in and also spaces are clean. Location is convenient",
      "Rui's apartment was great! It was very complete with complimentary coffee and other goodies. We would have loved to stay longer but only had one night. The kitchen was well equipped and had a vast collection of herbs and spices. Bathrooms were also great, complimentary shampoos and soaps. One of the best Airbnb's I have stayed at.",
      "Our family had an amazing stay  at Rae's place. Everything went well, the appartement  was clean, very well furnished and great view. Located in downtown west close to everything, very walkable and easy access to highways. Having access to the CTrain right downstairs was very convenient too.<br/>Rae was always very responsive.<br/>It was a very positive experience.",
      "It was pouring rain when we arrived, in a city and tricky to drive. We couldn’t find the building right away, but once we did, instructions were easy to follow, lots of pictures and host was very responsive to helping us! Space was just as pictured. Great views of the city, easy to park, drive wherever needed. Beds were comfortable and bathrooms were clean. 5 stars.",
      "We stayed at Rui appartment for a few weeks and really enjoyed our time here. The apartment was very clean, comfortable, and had beautiful views. We truly felt at home during our stay. The host was very kind and gave us clear and helpful instructions, which made everything easy. Highly recommended!",
      "Terrific place, very clean and beautifully decorated.  Loved all the decor - someone has good taste. Appreciated the snacks, comfortable beds, great view, location, great fully equipped kitchen.  Plenty of space, spotless. Very nice building.  You won't regret the stay.",
      "Rui is an excellent host. I liked the details Rui provided to access the property. They were very comprehensive. The house was good, spacious and well maintained. The location is perfect too, with two amazing Korean restaurants just outside the building. You can’t enter the property after 9 without a fob which I think is a great step to ensure  safety. Rui provided lot of amenities especially in the Kitchen which was great. You may not see the mountains well so just don’t choose if you plan to spend the evening looking at the mountains. Overall, it was a good stay.",
      "This place was great! Close to what we needed, easy to access restaurants and grocery store. Pictures to locate and explain entry were phenomenal and much appreciated. Condo was beautiful and clean and had everything we needed for a couple of days.",
      "Rae’s place was perfect for our group of two couples. It was within walking distance to restaurants and easy to get to. The condo was exactly as described and super clean! Rae was a very responsive host and gave clear instructions for check-in and parking. We would definitely stay again!",
      "Rui’s place has everything and she was an excellent host. Place is super walkable to great restaurants and many amenities. Whenever I needed anything she was available within minutes. I would definitely stay again in future!",
      "Very clean, well stocked and nicely styled condo. Handy if you need to access downtown Calgary.",
      "Rae’s apartment looks even better in real life. It’s huge, full of natural light, and extremely clean. It’s noticeable that Rae thought of every detail: from labeled kitchen doors, clear instructions, amazing lining, great soap, snacks and everything ultra clean. <br/>Top notch place! 10/10 would recommend.",
      "The place was as described-very clean and spacious. The host was responsive and flexible.  I would definitely recommend it.",
      "Very nice place. Well kept, great amenities, cozy place. The secure parking was awesome and really made us feel comfortable with a rental car in a downtown apartment.",
      "The accommodation itself was very nice with everything you need. The tram outside is noisy but gives free transport.",
      "Great location, excellent communication, and always responsive. Rae was very accommodating on our needs. Highly recommend to stay here during your next visit in Calgary.",
      "This is a great place to stay in Calgary. The apartment has everything we needed and a big plus that it’s right next to the C-train stop.",

The location is perfect too, with two amazing Korean restaurants just outside the building. You can’t enter the property after 9 without a fob which I think is a great step to ensure  safety. Rui provided lot of amenities especially in the Kitchen which was great. You may not see the mountains well so just don’t choose if you plan to spend the evening looking at the mountains.

      "The property was clean, comfortable and well equipped.  The neighbourhood is excellent with cafes, restaurants and a major grocery store all within a couple of blocks. The Beltline has a very lively nightlife, but nothing that some pink noise from your phone can’t handle. <br/>The hosts were great with communication and  timely with responses. Read and follow their instructions and all will go smoothly for you.  I would stay at their properties again without hesitation.",
      "Everything was fantastic!<br/>Our hosts were fantastic and answered any questions we had in a timely matter, plus all instructions they left were accurate and easy to follow. <br/>The place was spotless and also very accurate to the listing. I would like to add that the bed is VERY comfortable and soft as well so long term stays wouldn’t be a problem. <br/>If you’re wanting to do a lot of down town things I would suggest staying here for sure because there is a free parking garage right, and also paid parking right across the street.<br/>Thank you for the fantastic stay. I will definitely stay here again if I find myself in Calgary.",
      "I had a fantastic stay at Kyle’s home. The place was impeccably clean and featured stunning panoramic windows that flooded the space with natural light and offered breathtaking views. The modern decor and comfortable furnishings made it a truly welcoming retreat. Kyle was an attentive host who ensured everything was perfect for my visit. I highly recommend his home for anyone seeking a stylish and relaxing getaway.",

      "⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️<br/>I recently had the pleasure of staying at Kyle & Andrew's place in Calgary, and it was an outstanding experience! <br/>From the moment I arrived, everything was perfect - the property was immaculate, cozy, and exactly as described.

      "Andrew and Kyle were fantastic hosts! The unit was spotless upon arrival, it was easy to check into, and it was the perfect location for what we needed. Also, the view is better than it looks in the photos! 10/10 would stay here again!",
      "The space was beautiful. The views were amazing at night and during the day there’s tons of places within walking distance. Kevin and Kyle were helpful and were typically quick in response. I think the check in instructions could use some more detail but once we got the key fob entry and exit of the building was a breeze. Would stay here again for sure. Would like the ability to make it more dark in the bedroom during the mornings for sleeping but other than that no “complaints” of the property!",
      "Extremely pleased with this cozy 1 bedroom. Easy to walk to several places, easy to hop on the train. Great spot to relax after being in Banff for the day. Extremely clean and well set up BNB. Thank you!",
      "This space was perfect for us for a short stay, and had a great night view from the 26th floor. Walking distance to all amenities & the zoo was a short drive! Check in & out was straight forward and the hosts were very prompt with communication."

I would like to add that the bed is VERY comfortable and soft as well so long term stays wouldn’t be a problem. <br/>If you’re wanting to do a lot of down town things I would suggest staying here for sure because there is a free parking garage right, and also paid parking right across the street.<br/>Thank you for the fantastic stay. I will definitely stay here again if I find myself in Calgary.",

      "In general, our stay was really good! We loved the place and especially the location. The only downside was that the toilet wasn’t working the first night we arrived, so we had to manage until the next morning. Thankfully, it was fixed right away and we were compensated for the inconvenience. Overall, everything else was great—if I were to come back a second time, I’d definitely give it 5 stars!",
      "The couch is very dirty with visible stains , one will think twice before sitting on it, washroom didn’t have enough supplies - shower gel bottle was almost empty, bed sheets were smelly not sure if they were washed or not. View from the condo is nice - the only good thing about this place. Maintenance required - master bedroom closet door doesn’t close properly .",
      "Overall we had a great stay. It was during prime stampede time and for that, the location was perfectly located. Beautiful view and Neil was a great host. Super easy check in, and he was always responsive. The Air Conditioning wasn’t great and it got fairly hot in the condo however we didn’t spend a whole lot of time inside. Little bit of wear and tear from past guests but overall fairly close to the pictures/description.",
      "This is a great condo in a excellent location.  Lots of restaurants and things to do in walkable distance.  A few minor repairs are necessary but nothing that would hamper anyone’s stay.  The view at night is great.  Hosts are easy to reach and access instructions were straightforward and simple.  Thanks for a great stay.",
      "The place is a good size, big enough for four adults. It has a stunning view of downtown at night and in a great location. Walking distance to great food and bars. <br/>Bonus parking included in a garage. <br/>Neighborhood felt safe as did the apartment complex. <br/>Highly recommend.",
      "Nice, responsive host, great view, nice central location, free parking, and close to Stampede.<br/>Unit in need of major repairs. Toilet flush button broke, terrible towels, pillows and linens, no ice maker or ice trays, felt dirty, limited kitchen ware and supplies, broken closet doors, bed footboard broken, rusted shower rod and bad shower curtain, very confusing instructions and difficult to get in and out of building and garage. Host is friendly but this unit needs work.",
      "beautiful skyline view. However, the suite had so many broken furniture peices including the toilet. The floors where not cleaned as the bottoms of our feet were black after walking around barefoot. Neil was great at communicating. I just dont believe the price was worth the suite.",
      "It is very welcoming and beautiful place. Location is easy to find. The view is pretty at night. All the necessities are around the corner. It felt like home and peaceful.",
      "The place is strategically located and almost near to everything. The place has the magnificent view of the downtown skyline. It is an ideal place to explore the city. It has  work stations/ tables.",
      "Such a wonderful place and the view from the apartment is just Wow! Very clean place, private, safe, quiet and everything you need in the kitchen! it's right in downtown, easy walkable to everything and restaurants nearby! Neil and co-hosts are friendly, provided clear instructions for check-in which was easy to follow, and responded quickly to our questions! We would 100% reserve again next time we visit Calgary! Thanks Neil!",
      "I enjoyed the stay of six days. I did not spend much time locally due to busy schedule, but there seemed to be plenty of restaurants nearby. What really stood out in the place was the amazing view towards downtown from the 19th floor. I have stayed in many AirBnBs with nice views but this one took the price. The place was nice and had everything I needed.",
      "The view from the suite is breathtaking ! The floor to ceiling windows gives one a Birds eye view of the Calgary skyline .The location is perfect for all your downtown needs / the amenities in the area are first class / there are an umber of good pubs and restaurants within walking distance - I loved my stay and would return again",
      "Great place, easy to find, stress free parking. Will book again!",
      "Neil was a fantastic host! Was very quick at responding and loved the location! Will definitely come again!",
      "Nice place very well located. The view is quite beautiful, especially at night when the lights come out. Very close to downtown shopping and nightlife.",
      "The location was truly great, and I really appreciated their help with storing my luggage, especially since I had a tight schedule afterward. Thank you so much!",
      "Cute place and very well located, gym, bars restaurants, grocery and city center very close",
      "Neil was amazing and easy to communicate with<br/>The place was beautiful and felt so comfortable there",
      "Was a great place downtown to spend the weekend. Surprised my girlfriend with the view and she absolutely loved it. I would recommend to anyone need a wonderful place to stay downtown",
      "Found an open condom wrapper from what I assume previous guest, and host just ignored me when I tried to<br/>talk about it. Which is a shame because the apartment was nice and had a great view.",
      "Great place with great view. Very neat and well organized. Everything was easy to follow .<br/>Neil was very accomodating and responsive. Definitely recommend if visiting Calgary!",
      "I had a great stay as the location was incredibly convenient to where I needed to be.  When you walk outside at street level, there are a myriad of great options for dining! A fe w items that could benefit from maintenance, but nothing that impacted the stay. Would totally stay here again!",
      "Beautiful place with a perfect view of the city, clean and safe, an excellent experience, we loved it. Neil very attentive and willing to help, thank you very much for everything",
      "I would recommend this place to anyone needing a spot in downtown Calgary! This is the best Airbnb we have found in Calgary by far! The hosts are great, and the place is great as well! We will definitely be trying to book this airbnb every time we are back!"

      "This is a great place to stay, we walked to everything. The place was clean and we felt right at home, Jane was a great host very responsive with text!! Thanks for a great stay!",
      "Words cannot describe on how beautiful Jane’s place is during all hours of the day/night! Best air bnb view there is to offer in Calgary. I had even got locked out due to only having one fob but Jane was very helpful for getting me back in the building!!! Would stay here again💖",
      "This is the place you want if you wanna see Calgary at its finest. <br/>During the day, the view of the city is already beautiful full of life and energy. But at night, especially during sunset, it becomes absolutely breathtaking. The sky melts into orange, and as the city lights start to glow, the whole scene feels magical like something out of a dream.",
      "The place was very clean and in a super convenient location for me and my girls to experience the downtown life! Everything was close by and easy to get to. We had a great stay and I’d definitely come back when I’m in town again.<br/>Thank you Jane!!",
      "The place had an amazing view of the Calgary Tower and the beautiful skyline of downtown. It was in a great location — just about a 10-minute walk to 17th Avenue with lots of great restaurants and cafes. I really enjoyed my stay!",
      "My stay at Jane’s condo was absolutely perfect! The place was clean, modern, and had everything I needed for a comfortable visit. Jane was a fantastic host—super responsive, clear with her instructions, and genuinely caring about making sure I had a great experience. The check-in and check-out process was smooth and easy to follow. I especially appreciated the little touches and how well-equipped the condo was. I would definitely stay here again and highly recommend it to anyone visiting Calgary. Thanks again, Jane!",
      "Jane was great communicating from booking to finish.  The apartment is perfect for 1 or 2 couples.  Awesome views and has everything you need.  Definitely worth booking if you want to be in walking distance of the Stampede.  It was a great value and would stay again!  Thank you Jane.",
      "The apartment is perfectly located, easy to get in and out and access the main sights. <br/>The only thing that could have helped, would be to provide coffee for the first day. We spent one night as we were driving to Lake Louise the next morning but there is no coffee supplies for the first morning.",
      "The place was neat, the view was amazing. I wish there was one more couch to relax in the living room. But overall I loved the place and will definitely recommend it to anyone.",
      "Loved our stay! The location was great and the space was nice and clean with all the amenities we needed! <br/>Jane was always available and making sure that everything was to our expectations. <br/>Thank you so much for being a wonderful host! I would highly recommend this place",
      "The space is clean & bright. Decor tasteful. If you are a couch lounger not the space for you. Wife is a bed lounger & loved the views reading in the master bedroom during downtime. Well stocked bathroom items you can think of & a lovely deep tub. Kitchen has anything you could need with a nice selection of dry goods. Cooking oils, spices, instant coffee, coffee whitener & tea if that’s important to you. Everything was easy to find and well stocked. You can not beat the daytime & nighttime views. Breathtaking especially at night. Easy to navigate around with plenty of restaurants & a Starbucks across the street.<br/>Walking about felt safe & the playground about half a block over was excellent for our little one. Parking space is a nice size even for a larger vehicle.",
      "Very nice space and building, and beautiful view from high above the city. A great central location for wandering Calgary and taking in the view at the Calgary Tower.",
      "We had a wonderful weekend! Jane's  listing was a very relaxing place to come back to after a day of enjoying the city. We would have no problems recommending to anyone",
      "Really enjoyed our stay at Janes condo. She was very friendly and responsive. The unit was well stocked, the location is outstanding,  free indoor parking is a lifesaver and it was very clean. Great views from the balcony. Access with a fob to all doors makes you feel safe but you need a second fob if you are a bigger family. Improvements to be made is the need for a real couch. The small purple one is very uncomfortable especially if you are a family of 4, staying for a lomg period of time. 2 people can barely fit on it. Also the listing says gym on site and boardgames but they are both not available. Beds are a bit firm but that is a personal preference. Overall its a great place and I highly recommend staying here.",
      "Everything about this place was truly excellent. The apartment was sparkling clean, cozy, and exactly as pictured. It felt comfortable and well‑cared‑for—from the well‑equipped kitchen to the thoughtfully arranged living space. The place was spotless, beautifully decorated, and even better than the photos. The decor created such a relaxing atmosphere, and the views were absolutely stunning—such a treat to wake up to! Jane was welcoming and made check‑in and check‑out effortless. Bonus points for the convenient location and peaceful ambience. I wish I could have stayed longer, and I’d highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a great stay!"

Kitchen has anything you could need with a nice selection of dry goods. Cooking oils, spices, instant coffee, coffee whitener & tea if that’s important to you. Everything was easy to find and well stocked. You can not beat the daytime & nighttime views. Breathtaking especially at night. Easy to navigate around with plenty of restaurants & a Starbucks across the street.<br/>Walking about felt safe & the playground about half a block over was excellent for our little one. Parking space is a nice size even for a larger vehicle.",

The unit was well stocked, the location is outstanding,  free indoor parking is a lifesaver and it was very clean. Great views from the balcony. Access with a fob to all doors makes you feel safe but you need a second fob if you are a bigger family. Improvements to be made is the need for a real couch. The small purple one is very uncomfortable especially if you are a family of 4, staying for a lomg period of time. 2 people can barely fit on it. Also the listing says gym on site and boardgames but they are both not available. Beds are a bit firm but that is a personal preference. Overall its a great place and I highly recommend staying here.",

The decor created such a relaxing atmosphere, and the views were absolutely stunning—such a treat to wake up to! Jane was welcoming and made check‑in and check‑out effortless.

The only struggle I had was parking but we decided to park outside across the street and we had no issues at all.",

The host was very responsive and took care of our questions/requests very quickly.<br/>One thing to note is that the apartment is near a bottle depot and trash trucks woke us up in one morning. Light sleepers might find this a problem but it doesn’t affect us much. Overall, we enjoy our stay at Benji’s!",
      "Great location and modern apartment. Only downside was the access system to the apartment. The elevator takes ages especially when busy with other residents, meaning it was hard to make it up to the apartment within the 3 minute period from buzzing in at reception due to the amount of people in the building. Other than that the place is perfect.",
      "Had a great experience. The place was well organized and found everything we needed. Benji is super helpful and responsive. It was very awesome of him to find a flat iron for me to use for a day.<br/>One thing they should improve on is the cleanliness. It looked clean but the floor was quite dirty, especially underneath the couch and beds. Overall, it was very good! 👍",

The elevator takes ages especially when busy with other residents, meaning it was hard to make it up to the apartment within the 3 minute period from buzzing in at reception due to the amount of people in the building. Other than that the place is perfect.",

      "We had a wonderful one-month stay here 😊 The condo is quiet, very comfortable, and fully equipped with everything needed for daily life. It was also super convenient for work, the guest room even has a auto-adjustable desk, docking station, and monitor, which made remote working really easy.<br/>The host was amazing, very kind, quick to respond, and always helpful. Communication was smooth from start to finish. This place really made our stay in Calgary comfortable. Highly recommend staying here!",
      "Stacey's place is cozy and authentic; it felt like a home, not just some cookie cutter hotel-like unit bought up for the sole purpose of renting out. She has fun playful decor, the space is tidy and uncluttered, and we felt at home immediately. Neighborhood was great for walks, and there were a lot of great restaurants nearby. If we're back in Calgary we would definitely stay here again!",
      "Such a convenient downtown location, super walkable to many restaurants, grocery stores, shopping, and entertainment! Stacey was warm and welcoming and made the check in process very simple! The condo was very spacious and comfortable, with a lovely open kitchen. Would definitely recommend to anyone visiting Calgary!",
      "Nice centrally located unit with plenty of space for two adults and two small children.  Host was easy to contact and responded quickly.  Unit was clean and everything worked great. Would stay here again.",
      "Stacey’s place was the perfect place for a week getaway. The place was just as described with it being more spacious than we thought. It was central and walkable to all the restaurants in the area. We felt safe and would definitely book again.",
      "my stay was great a home away from home will love to do it again",

Es war wirklich an alles gedacht – von Kaffee bis hin zu Waschmittel war alles vorhanden, was man für einen angenehmen Aufenthalt braucht.

Boeden also provided us local recommendations to visit as well. Highly recommend",

We came for the Stampede which was within easy walking distance as were the great restaurants around the apartment - loved the pedestrian only area on 8th Ave SW.

We would stay here again for sure!",

      "Great place to stay - great restaurant<br/>Recommendations right by the apartment and a safe 10 min walk from my conference at the Telus convention Center.  The bed was comfortable for me but was on the thinner side so might not be comfortable for everyone. <br/>The A/C was broken so Boeden had someone come in with a portable A/C the evening I arrived so I could sleep (the apartment was 25 C).  Unfortunately the portable A/C blocked the exit onto the balcony.  Thank you Boeden for resolving my issue so promptly. <br/>I would definitely stay here again",

We came for the Stampede which was within easy walking distance as were the great restaurants around the apartment - loved the pedestrian only area on 8th Ave SW.  It was busy but a great vibe in the city.  Boeden was very helpful with suggestions for things around the apartment (restaurants, stores, parking, etc) and super prompt responding to messages.  We would stay here again for sure!",

The bed was comfortable for me but was on the thinner side so might not be comfortable for everyone. <br/>The A/C was broken so Boeden had someone come in with a portable A/C the evening I arrived so I could sleep (the apartment was 25 C).  Unfortunately the portable A/C blocked the exit onto the balcony.  Thank you Boeden for resolving my issue so promptly. <br/>I would definitely stay here again",

    "description": "It's the spot, it's the vibe, it's the Vü. Located in the heart of Calgary's Beltline community, you're within easy walking distance to the Stampede, Scotiabank Saddledome and some of Canada's top dining destinations. If your goal is to unwind, detoxify in the 2-person infrared sauna or lounge on the 15-foot private balcony with views of the Calgary Tower & Canada Day/Stampede fireworks. A gateway to the Canadian Rockies; find yourself exploring the mountain ranges within a scenic hour's drive.The spaceWHY CHOOSE US…+ THE VÜ: Front row seating to the Stampede fireworks from the living room or the 15-foot long private patio, with peeking views of the iconic Calgary tower. The southeast-facing, floor-to-ceiling windows span from the primary bedroom throughout the living room. Those that live for sunrises are going to fall in love with the vü. If you prefer to rise without the shine, each window has a blind so you can blissfully hit snooze over & over again. + LOCATION: Anything you could want is within a 10-minute walking radius. Whether you’re here for Stampede, catching a concert/hockey game at the Scotiabank Saddledome, or just craving a night out downtown without needing a car - this is it. Local-favourites Ten Foot Henry’s Restaurant is across the street & Proof cocktail bar is right at the bottom of our building, so you barely need to step outside to experience Calgary’s downtown must-sees. Here to see the mountains? You’re only an hour away from Canmore, or two from Banff & Lake Louise. + PRIVATE SAUNA: Immerse yourself with an at-home spa treatment with a session in the 2-person infrared sauna. Choose how you zen; level up the experience with your favourite show on the swivel Smart TV or toss on your favourite slide from the bedroom’s solar system projector. We leave extra towels for the sauna so you don’t need to worry about getting your bathing towels icky.+ HOME OFFICE: As remote workers, we understand the pains of working on an uncomfortable kitchen chair, or spending your day’s wages at a coffee shop.* We built a tucked away workstation with a monitor, HDMI cord, mousepad and an ergonomic mouse so you can clock-in while on vacay in comfort & style. The kitchen island bar seats are adjustable and extremely comfortable with power outlets on both ends, if you require extra work space. (*P.s.. If coffee shops are your jam - there’s a Starbucks just across the street.)+ DOG-FRIENDLY: We provide a dog bed, a dedicated dog blanket & dog bowls so even your furry friend feels like they’re on vacation. There are plenty of dog-friendly parks nearby to let them roam.+ COMFORT: From central air-conditioning, to luxurious 100% cotton sheets, white noise machines and too many cup choices… We filled the space with items that aren’t just aesthetically-pleasing, but provide a level of comfort & function that we enjoy - and hope you will too. + UNDERGROUND PARKING: Your stay includes access to a single (1) underground parking space with a clearance of 6’9”. If you have a taller vehicle, there’s a large parking lot one block from us. + SUSTAINABLE: Working in this industry for so long, we know firsthand the incredible amount of waste that crafting rental units can make. We made it our mission to take our time, and either build or refurbish/repurpose/reuse as many items as possible to furnish the space (our FB Marketplace game is STRONG.) We also offer refillable items and stock eco-friendly products from local markets (no mini shampoo bottles here!)

      "We had a wonderful stay at Michael & Regina’s place. The space was quiet, clean and well appointed, with amazing views. The included parking was a nice touch. Given where it is, there are a ton of great restaurants within walking distance or a very quick Uber ride. Would recommend staying here if you’re looking for a spot in Calgary.",
      "Excellent location with plenty to walk to or simply view through the gorgeous windows and balcony space. Had all the amenities as listed, including incredibly comfortable beds and sofa. Greatly appreciated the clear instructions and accurate photos of the space. Any concerns we had during our stay were promptly addressed and resolved by the hosts.",
      "This was the perfect place to say for anything at the Saddledome, great restaurants and some shopping. We love that we could walk everywhere. The place was beautifully decorated with cozy blankets and nice dishes and mugs. Great place to stay if you want to be close to it all.",
      "We had a great stay! The location was perfect for us - super walkable and close to everything we needed. The unit itself was beautiful and clean, with great views. Would totally recommend and will definitely stay again the next time we have to be in Calgary!",
      "Really enjoyed staying here! Lots of natural light and the apartment was gorgeous. The sauna doesn’t get too hot and does take a while to heat up (at least an hour if not more) so keep that in mind. Michael and Regina were very communicative and responsive. Would absolutely stay again!",
      "We enjoyed our time at the apartment for a few days — it was clean, comfortable, quiet, and walkable to everything in downtown. Would definitely stay here again next time I’m in Calgary!",
      "Great place to stay in a convenient location. Hosts were super helpful, even let us know we could check in early since the cleaners were done. The sauna is an awesome and unique touch, as well as the games. Beat my brother in backgammon many times- definitely recommend.",
      "We really enjoyed staying here. Easy walk to the Calgary Stampede. Perfect place to sit and watch the fireworks after the Stampede evening performance. The apartment  is clean and quiet; the building is secure.  Nice restaurants within walking distance.",
      "Mike & Regina's place was our home away from home when we were displaced due to flooding. Their place was super clean, nicely decorated, with luxury bedding/towels and stocked with amenities.  You can't beat the incredible views their place has to offer with the floor to ceiling windows. The sauna was such a nice little luxury especially during colder months. Location wise their place is right in the middle of so many restaurants and good bars literally steps away. They were very responsive when we had questions and were great at communicating. Highly recommend to others 😊",
      "Michael and Regina’s place was amazing. The beds were comfortable, great views and had everything you need.They were always responsive. Loved our stay.",
      "Lovely stay at Michael and Regina’s place in the Beltline.  If possible, the unit in person is even more beautiful than the pictures.  Wonderfully and tastefully appointed through with all the amenities and more need for a great stay and the unit was immaculate throughout.  Great balcony for city views as well.  Location is *perfect* for visiting Calgary, with some of the best restaurants and bars in Calgary literally at your doorstep and an easy walk to downtown or to shopping further into the Beltline.  Also, wonderful, friendly, and responsive hosts with a very clear and easy check-in/check-out process - A++ to Michael and Regina.  Couldn’t recommend more highly!",
      "Perfect choice for convenience to the convention center and some of the best restaurants ever, like Calcutta Cricket Club and Ten Foot Henry, just a few steps away.  Everything in this apartment is in mint condition and high quality.  The furniture is extremely comfortable, the towels are thick and fluffy,  and the windows provide plenty of natural light.  It was easy to use the wifi, TV, and kitchen appliances.  The owners, Regina and Michael, are super-friendly and responsive.  The building feels safe and secure, with an immaculate simple lobby and hallways.  I would definitely stay here again, and recommend it highly.",
      "Michael and Regina are great hosts. Very proactive and responsive to messages. The place is beautiful and location is perfect",
      "Amazing hosts who were extra responsive!  The views are spectacular and fully equipped with everything we needed.  Super friendly hosts who were friendly and accommodating.",
      "I recently stayed in this condo, and it was a great experience! The highlight was definitely the indoor sauna in one of the bedrooms - such a luxurious touch that made the stay feel like a mini wellness retreat. The condo itself had everything I needed for a comfortable stay. The location was perfect, within walking distance to everything.<br/>Check-in was seamless. If you’re looking for a unique stay in Calgary with a bit of extra relaxation, I highly recommend this spot!<br/>Would definitely book again!",

We leave extra towels for the sauna so you don&#x2019;t need to worry about getting your bathing towels icky.\n<br>\n<br>\n+ HOME OFFICE: As remote workers, we understand the pains of working on an uncomfortable kitchen chair, or spending your day&#x2019;s wages at a coffee shop.* We built a tucked away workstation with a monitor, HDMI cord, mousepad and an ergonomic mouse so you can clock-in while on vacay in comfort &amp; style. The kitchen island bar seats are adjustable and extremely comfortable with power outlets on both ends, if you require extra work space. (*P.s.. If coffee shops are your jam - there&#x2019;s a Starbucks just across the street.)\n<br>\n<br>\n+ DOG-FRIENDLY: We provide a dog bed, a dedicated dog blanket &amp; dog bowls so even your furry friend feels like they&#x2019;re on vacation. There are plenty of dog-friendly parks nearby to let them roam.\n<br>\n<br>\n+ COMFORT: From central air-conditioning, to luxurious 100% cotton sheets, white noise machines and too many cup choices&#x2026; We filled the space with items that aren&#x2019;t just aesthetically-pleasing, but provide a level of comfort &amp; function that we enjoy - and hope you will too. \n<br>\n<br>\n+ UNDERGROUND PARKING: Your stay includes access to a single (1) underground parking space with a clearance of 6&#x2019;9&#x201D;. If you have a taller vehicle, there&#x2019;s a large parking lot one block from us. \n<br>\n<br>\n+ SUSTAINABLE: Working in this industry for so long, we know firsthand the incredible amount of waste that crafting rental units can make. We made it our mission to take our time, and either build or refurbish/repurpose/reuse as many items as possible to furnish the space (our FB Marketplace game is STRONG.) We also offer refillable items and stock eco-friendly products from local markets (no mini shampoo bottles here!) \n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nWHAT CAN I EXPECT IN THE SPACE? \n<br>\n<br>\n&#x2600;&#xFE0F; &#x200B;&#x200B;Primary Bedroom: \n<br>\n<br>\n+ King bed with a hybrid comfort Emma mattress\n<br>\n+ 4 pillows with adjustable firm/plushness\n<br>\n+ 100% cotton sheets\n<br>\n+ White noise machine\n<br>\n+ Mirrored-closet with hangers, clothes rack, a dresser &amp; a luggage rack\n<br>\n+ Dedicated workstation \n<br>\n+ Floor-to-ceiling, east-facing windows, each with room-darkening blinds\n<br>\n+ Blackout curtains for the sliding doors that separate the living room and bedroom\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n&#x1F319; Second Bedroom: \n<br>\n<br>\n+ Queen bed with an Endy mattress\n<br>\n+ Private 2-person infrared sauna w/ extra towels\n<br>\n+ 40&#x201D; Smart TV on a swivel base to watch in bed or the sauna\n<br>\n+ 12-slide solar system projector\n<br>\n+ Ceiling fan\n<br>\n+ White noise machine\n<br>\n+ Reading lamp\n<br>\n+ 4 pillows with adjustable firm/plushness\n<br>\n+ 100% cotton sheets\n<br>\n+ Mirrored-closet with hangers, clothes rack, storage shelves, a luggage rack, and a pack &amp; play\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n&#x1F6CB;&#xFE0F; Living Room: \n<br>\n<br>\n+ 55&#x201D; Smart/Roku TV atop an electric fireplace\n<br>\n+ Wide/cozy couch &amp; the iconic PO&#xC4;NG to kick back on\n<br>\n+ A selection of cozy blankets to bundle up in \n<br>\n+ Electric fireplace \n<br>\n+ Selection of games &amp; books\n<br>\n+ Floor-to-ceiling, southeast-facing windows, each with room-darkening blinds **perfect viewing space for the Stampede/Canada day fireworks!** \n<br>\n<br>\n&#x1F386; Patio/Balcony: \n<br>\n<br>\n+ 15-foot balcony\n<br>\n+ 4-seater outdoor sectional sofa\n<br>\n+ Views of the Calgary Tower, Stampede fireworks, city skyline &amp; more\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n&#x1F468;&#x200D;&#x1F373; Kitchen: \n<br>\n<br>\n+ Keurig K-Duo coffee maker\n<br>\n+ Electric kettle\n<br>\n+ Mini (3-quart) instant pot\n<br>\n+ Air fryer\n<br>\n+ Blender\n<br>\n+ Coffee grinder \n<br>\n+ Ice/water dispenser on the fridge\n<br>\n+ Ground coffee, tea &amp; sugar\n<br>\n+ Olive oil \n<br>\n+ Paper towel (1/stay)\n<br>\n+ Cooking &amp; baking essentials (baking sheet, sharp knives, etc.)\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n&#x1F6C1; Full Bathroom:\n<br>\n<br>\n+ Shower/tub combo \n<br>\n+ Hair dryer\n<br>\n+ Shampoo/conditioner/body wash/hand soap\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n&#x1F6BB; Half Bathroom: \n<br>\n<br>\n+ Hair dryer\n<br>\n+ Makeup towels\n<br>\n+ Expansive mirror that makes getting ready to go out a breeze\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n&#x1F43E; Dog-Friendly Bits: \n<br>\n<br>\n+ Dog bed \n<br>\n+ Dedicated dog blanket \n<br>\n+ Dog food tray &amp; dishes\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n&#x1F4BB; Dedicated Workstation: \n<br>\n<br>\n+ Desk chair\n<br>\n+ Computer monitor\n<br>\n+ HDMI cord/dongle \n<br>\n+ Ergonomic mouse &amp; pad\n<br>\n&#x200B;&#x200B;\n<br>\n<br>\n&#x2728;Honorary Mentions: \n<br>\n<br>\n+ Foldable wagon/cart to help make hauling your items up &amp; down a little easier\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nHOW FAR AM I FROM&#x2026;?\n<br>\n<br>\n+ Calgary Stampede Grounds (10-minute walk)\n<br>\n+ Scotiabank Saddledome (10-minute walk)\n<br>\n+ BMO Centre (10-minute walk)\n<br>\n+ Kananaskis (1-hour drive)\n<br>\n+ Canmore (1-hour drive)\n<br>\n+ Banff (1.5 hour drive)\n<br>\n+ Lake Louise (2-hour drive)\n<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"_g5uevq\">Guest access</span>\n<br>\nGUEST ACCESS\n<br>\n<br>\nGuests will have access to the entirety of the unit, along with a single (1) underground parking space.

      "Had a nice stay at Jesse’s condo. I booked last minute and had a really seamless check in process. The space was clean and well stocked including things like cooking oil and spices. I deducted a star because I found the bed to be very soft to the point of discomfort while sleeping. Otherwise this was a 5 star stay in a great location with a great host.",
      "Only downside is that getting into the parking lot is mildly inconvenient with the remote needed from inside the apartment. Other than that the place is perfect and a great price.",
      "We had a lovely stay at Jesse’s place. The condo is very comfortable and in an excellent location. Jesse is quite possibly the most responsive host that I have dealt with!  We had absolutely no concerns and would be happy to stay there again …",
      "Jesse's place was great and the detailed instructions for getting into the building and parking were excellent. The location was perfect, right in the heart of downtown with excellent restaurants nearby. the Food Hall across the street was very handy and yummy.",

      "Really enjoyed our short stay! Great location, apartment is very spacious, lots of sunlight. We were positively surprised with kitchen - you can find not only normally provided staff like glasses and plates, but spices, sugar, cooking oil, simple things which could make it way more convenient if you like to cook. Communication with Jesse was great as well - very helpful(I made sure to ask stupid questions:)) and friendly. Would recommend!",
      "Great stay! Jesse was very responsive and checked in to make sure everything was going smoothly. The apartment is in a great location—just a short walk to downtown, with plenty of restaurants and coffee shops nearby. It also has a nice view of the city skyline. The space was clean, well-equipped, and had everything I needed for a comfortable stay. Highly recommend!",
      "Beyond what I have listed in my ratings about the location, cleanliness, and host responsiveness I wanted to highlight that they beds were very comfortable and the pillows were a premium variety (none of that folding pillows in half to get a decent head lift lol). Great stay, completely as advertised and right in the heart of downtown - close to working spaces, excellent food and drink options, and also to the Stampede grounds. Fantastic stay!",
      "Clean place, exactly as described. Thoughtful details that a lot of other hosts miss. Location couldn't be better. Jesse is a very responsive and accommodating host. Would stay here again without hesitation.",
      "Although I had sent my id for the host twice, my access was not activated because of id request!<br/>The condo was clean , but the second bedroom was actually a den without walls or window",

      "Great place to stay in downtown Calgary, great view, awesome place to stay, and very helpful host. We had a little of trouble getting in (totally my fault, didn’t read the instructions well enough) and Jesse was extremely helpful and made sure we made it in. Very nice furniture, comfortable beds, and was extremely clean! Would definitely recommend a stay!",

The outdoor pool was closed so that would have been nice to know ahead of booking our stay. <br/>The communication from Beth however, was amazing! She addressed every concern right away and offered solutions.",
      "Will definitely book again when having coworkers in for work as well use as referral if other guest require somewhere to stay. Place was convenient and affordable for the location!",
      "Beth was a great host. Very quick to respond to questions at any time, which was super helpful. The airbnb was spotless, check-in was easy, and the location was convenient, close to many attractions. Thanks, Beth!",
      "Our stay at this place was great and very comfortable. It is a new-er construction with many modern features, located at the very center of Calgary. It was well equipped with all the necessities and the place was kept very clean. 10 minute walk west to co-op groceries, 20 minute walk north to peace bridge and river walk, 20 minute walk east to central shopping district, and 3 streets away from the light rail, LRT. This place was perfect to venture out to see the core of Calgary. We enjoyed our stay and thank you for hosting us.",
      "Enjoyed our stay in the condo. Very central, close to a grocery store, downtown attractions. The condo had everything we needed. It was spotless. Enjoyed the two washrooms, washer/dryer. Only thing is the fob system, there's only one. We were limited as a family on going anywhere. If husband left for hockey game with child. Wife stayed did some groceries with other child...he came back tried calling and the process in very unclear on what procedures to follow.",
      "This place is great! Great location. Very well stocked. Nice and clean. Comfy beds. <br/>Host was very easy to communicate with. Always answered our questions super quickly! I would definitely recommend this place!",
      "Everything about our stay was great. The location is central and close to everything we needed and walkable. A short 5 min walk to Safeway for groceries was awesome. The hosts were friendly and helpful. The space was clean and well kept. The parking spot fit a Nissan Frontier with no problem, and we parked a second vehicle across the street in an Impark lot for a reasonable price. We would be happy to stay here again.",
      "We loved our stay! It was pretty central to most things, so it never took us very long to get anywhere and super close to c train stations. Lots of nightlife around and great restaurants within walking distance. Place was super nice and clean - would definitely stay again!",
      "A great place to stay and the host was very responsive and attended to our needs.  Thank you and surely we will come back to your place whenever we have another opportunity to visit Calgary again.  Thanks a lot for your assistance.",
      "Great place to stay with a responsive and proactive host. The place was clean and enjoyable to stay in. The check-in process was a bit arduous with a third party website (property management style), this portion of the experience I did not enjoy.",
      "We had a great experience. The place was clean, well-equipped, and exactly as described. The location was perfect—close to everything we needed but still quiet and relaxing. I’d definitely stay here again and highly recommend it to anyone visiting the area!",
      "Great place to stay, and I will definitely stay there again. Amazing hosts, who were very responsive. The unit is modern, clean, and well-kept.",
      "We were in Calgary for a wedding and we enjoyed our stay for 5 nights. Location was great and close to many restaurants.",
      "A great stay downtown Calgary, I would totally recommend it! It’s central so it’s super close to everything and it had some stellar views of the city!",
      "Very good location. Excellent place. Not every child friendly for under 3 yrs if you have young children.",
      "The place was beautiful and close to many restaurants, bars, and shopping. I will definitely stay here or with this group again when I go back to Calgary!  <br/>For future guests: Please know that there is a bottle depot (recycling/refund for bottles) across the street that may attract a certain group of people. Please do be careful and drive slowly when going through the alley to the parking garage as these types of people seem to not pay attention and may wonder infront of your vehicle without looking and gather in groups to work on phones/bikes. This is expected in any downtown area. This has no impact on my staying here again. I do recommend this place!",
      "This Airbnb was a wonderful . Right from the check in it was easy. They gave clear instructions and was easy to access. The condo itself was gorgeous. Close to tons of restaurants and shopping downtown Calgary with amazing views of the Calgary Tower, but had amenities in the apartment that could stay in if we wanted. Couldn’t have asked for a better place to stay while in Calgary.",
      "Quick response to our questions was very much appreciated. Great location and nice decor.",
      "Clean spot in a great location! Beth took good care of us. I would stay again.",
      "Our stay was great! The place was extremely clean and had everything we needed! Would definitely stay again!",
      "great location, responsive host and clear instructions. the place was great for our family of 5",
      "Good comfortable stay in a central location. It is close to a train track and bottle depot which can get noisy at times.",
      "A 10/10 stay! Beth was very, very responsive to any questions or concerns we had. The apartment is in a great location and has lots of natural light! Would definitely return."

I will definitely stay here or with this group again when I go back to Calgary!  <br/>For future guests: Please know that there is a bottle depot (recycling/refund for bottles) across the street that may attract a certain group of people. Please do be careful and drive slowly when going through the alley to the parking garage as these types of people seem to not pay attention and may wonder infront of your vehicle without looking and gather in groups to work on phones/bikes. This is expected in any downtown area. This has no impact on my staying here again. I do recommend this place!",

      "I had a really nice time with friends here. the place is very beautiful, and big. The view is also pretty, worth what you paid for. The instructions are very helpful, and I really like the fact the host’s are easy to communicate with! Definitely recommend!",
      "Our stay at Chloe and Jason’s Airbnb was amazing. Apartment was clean, stocked up, and had a comfortable environment. Great area for many different activities and restaurants. 10/10. Thank you!",
      "Chloe and Jason’s place was perfect for what we had planned in the city! Close walk to the Calgary tower, quick drive to the zoo for a day and tons of restaurants near by. The view was amazing, we could easily see all of Calgary with a perfect view of the tower! <br/>Inside had everything we needed to feel at home! The bed in the second bedroom was a little uncomfortable for two people, I would say only one person in there would be best! However the view and location made up for all of that ☺️",
      "The apartment was exactly as shown in the photos, and the view was incredible, especially at night.<br/>The apartment had everything we needed.<br/>The hosts communicated perfectly — all the instructions were clear, easy to follow, and very detailed, even with attached photos.",
      "Great location for a long weekend; everything downtown was walkable. Kitchen was stocked and everything was very clean. Super detailed instructions made check in easy, even when we arrived a few hours later than expected. The unit is a bit small for five adults (only four bath towels provided) but it’s a great option if you plan to be out on the town enjoying the city and want more space than a hotel. We would definitely stay here again!",
      "The pictures don't do justice to the beautiful view and peaceful space. The hosts were very responsive (my parents stayed here while I was in Texas so quick responses were important!) and the experience was fantastic. This is an amazing space for exploring Calgary or enjoying the beauty of the area.",
      "We stayed here with our family and everything was great! The apartment was clean, cozy, and well-equipped — it had everything we needed for a comfortable stay. The location was very convenient, and the host was friendly and quick to respond to any questions. We really enjoyed our time here and felt at home. I’ll definitely choose this place again when I come back to Calgary. Highly recommend to anyone visiting the city!",
      "This was a great spot to stay for Stampede as it was only a 5 minute walk to the grounds. Also surrounded by restaurants, shops, and a quick 10 minute walk to Stephen Ave.",
      "I had a great stay here. The host was really nice and informative, which made everything so easy. The view was amazing, and the location was super convenient for getting around. I’d definitely recommend this place and would stay here again.",
      "Chloe and Jason’s place was amazing! The views were phenomenal, it was easy to access and plenty of local bars, restaurants and attractions in the area. Great place to stay, will definitely be back!",
      "Beautiful apartment downtown! <br/>We made our way to Calgary for my Birthday and Chloe and Jason's bnb was definitely the right choice! Their thorough instructions including maps and restaurant recommendations made everything so easy since we're not super familiar with Calgary. The bnb was very tastefully decorated, located in a quiet building and had everything we needed for a fun and relaxing stay. <br/>We caught a show downtown that was close enough to walk, right across the street you have a delicious late night pizza place and Starbucks for your morning coffee. I'm not sure which was more beautiful- the city skyline view at night or the view in the early morning! <br/>All in all was a great place to stay and helped make our trip absolutely perfect!",
      "Great play to stay! Good restaurants near by and coffee right across the street. The view is amazing and the location is great. The place was super clean and looked super great! The only thing is I couldn’t convert the “sofa bed” and not sure if it actually is one, but slept on it like a normal couch. Hopefully I was just doing it wrong and that’s not the case! Otherwise everything was great. The duvets were super soft and I loved them.",
      "Great location with convenient underground parking. Quick to respond to messages.",
      "Great stay! Very peaceful. The hosts were very responsive and flexible with booking.",
      "Chloe and Jason were wonderful hosts, and very responsive whenever we had questions or concerns.",
      "Nice place with nice views and is situated in a convenient location. Clean place with comfy beds and sofa. The hosts are very accommodating and replies to inquiries almost instantly. I would 100% recommend this place.",
      "Great location and amazing views",
      "The place was a great value for the money, with an excellent location and an incredible view of the city. It’s comfortable for one couple, but the smaller bedroom is more suited for use as an office rather than a second sleeping space. The walls are also quite thin, so noise from neighboring units, hallway or within the apartment is loud. We had some challenges communicating with the host, including not receiving the correct number of towels. We also suggested providing a second fob key, as sharing one isn’t ideal for groups with different schedules. Overall, the stay was enjoyable, and with a few improvements, it could be even better!",
      "It was a very cozy, clean, and well-located place.",
      "Everything is accessible, it is located in the heart of the city. We enjoyed our stay. Great restaurants and bars are just a stroll away. FANTASTIC CITY VIEW!",
      "This was a good property in a great location, with wonderful hosts. The only issue was that the on-site laundry wasn't working.",
      "Check in was a little different having to get into building to obtain key fob for garage but doable. Instructions were good. Great view and clean apartment.",
      "All good",
      "Great place for a quick stay!"

Their thorough instructions including maps and restaurant recommendations made everything so easy since we're not super familiar with Calgary. The bnb was very tastefully decorated, located in a quiet building and had everything we needed for a fun and relaxing stay. <br/>We caught a show downtown that was close enough to walk, right across the street you have a delicious late night pizza place and Starbucks for your morning coffee. I'm not sure which was more beautiful- the city skyline view at night or the view in the early morning! <br/>All in all was a great place to stay and helped make our trip absolutely perfect!",

It’s comfortable for one couple, but the smaller bedroom is more suited for use as an office rather than a second sleeping space. The walls are also quite thin, so noise from neighboring units, hallway or within the apartment is loud. We had some challenges communicating with the host, including not receiving the correct number of towels. We also suggested providing a second fob key, as sharing one isn’t ideal for groups with different schedules. Overall, the stay was enjoyable, and with a few improvements, it could be even better!",

      "Angela's place was centrally located on the eight floor of the building and with an elevator easily accessible.  We enjoyed the clean space with a nice of Calgarys skyline and the TV tower. Parking in the building was a bit tricky to figure out for people coming from outside of Canada, although there are clear instructions.",
      "We had such a wonderful stay! The place was clean, cozy, and exactly as described in the listing. Angela was very responsive and accommodating, which made everything smooth and stress-free. The location was perfect, close to everything we needed yet quiet enough to relax. Would definitely recommend staying here and would love to come back!! ☺️",

      "Our stay at Angela’s place was spectacular! Definitely exceeded my expectations. The unit is right downtown Calgary, surrounded by awesome restaurants, bars and a few local spots. The building itself is easy to navigate and Angela’s unit is beautiful. We stayed as a pair and were more than comfortable with the two bedroom two bathroom, a group of 4 could stay with plenty of space. Angela left everything you could need, and the place had spectacular views of the city with the full windows and balcony. I would 100% return and stay again at Angela’s place!",

      "This unit is great for a friend trip. spacious for 4 people, lots of getting ready space, open kitchen and living space for communal time, but closed bedrooms for privacy. loved that there were 2 bathrooms. it's walkable to so many things (saddledome, stephens walk,  17th ave). there are good restaurants, a food hall, Starbucks all within steps of the front door. Great views of downtown (Calgary tower) and excellent for people watching. the decor was beautiful and minimal with the comforts of home added (basket full of throw blankets for the couch with comfy throw pillows).",

The building itself is easy to navigate and Angela’s unit is beautiful. We stayed as a pair and were more than comfortable with the two bedroom two bathroom, a group of 4 could stay with plenty of space. Angela left everything you could need, and the place had spectacular views of the city with the full windows and balcony. I would 100% return and stay again at Angela’s place!",

Plus, there's a great market right behind the building! Amandeep is very careful with the instructions and gives great tips about the surroundings! When I come back to Calgary, I'll stay there!",
      "We had a great short stay at Amin’s place. The place was a 40 mins walk from stampede and the area was safe.  It had a kitchen and a dishwasher but no dishwasher detergent. Also the AC did not work at the time of our stay. The location was great, there’s a coop right behind and pubs and coffee shops are within walking distance. <br/>Thank you.",
      "Amin's place is great and well equipped for 2 people to stay. It is very comfortable and had everything we needed. This is a great neighbourhood, with a grocery store across the parking lot, shops, boutiques and restaurants all within walking distance. a great jumping off point to see the rest of the city.",
      "Amin was a fantastic host. When I met her, she was thorough in explaining all the amenities around her lodging and was very easy to contact if I had any problems. Furthermore, her lodging is positioned in a very happening part of downtown.",
      "Neat little condo on the 16th floor, garage was easy access and building was well-maintained. Only big downside at the time was the dirtiness of the balcony & windows, which I’m sure they’ll have cleaned in the future. Great location.",
      "Amin's place was super clean and easy to find! Great location downtown while not being too close to the craziness of stampede. Super convenient with the co-op right there as well.",
      "Amin was a fantastic host! She met me and ensured I knew where to find everything within the condo. As well, she made herself accessible should I require anything additional. Thank-you!",
      "Great place to explore Calgary. Excellent location close to Ctrain and plenty of places to eat/drink closeby. Amin welcomed us and personally and   communicated clearly throughout our stay. We had a problem with the fob for entering the garage not working and Amin made every effort to get us new batteries (including buying a chocolate fudge cake to make up for the inconvenience - thanks again!). The balcony is facing east making it ideal for an outdoor breakfast on a sunny spring morning. The bed is comfortable. No wifi or tv connection when we stayed there. ",

      "Amin is a great host.  Very responsive and easy to deal with.  Her condo is in a great location with an adjacent grocery store,  great coffee shops and restaurants nearby.  Close to two train stations.  Great place if your in town for business or to soak up some western hospitality.",

      "The home was unique and cozy. It has some beautiful upgrades while maintaining the Craftsman style. The proximity to restaurants was great. There is also a park with a walking path close by. The beds were very comfortable. The home had everything we needed and Nicolas was very responsive. We would stay there again.",
      "One of the most communicative host's I have had the pleasure of booking with in some time. Very flexible and always a message away. The space is comfortable, stylish, and a private getaway tucked away close to pretty much everything you would want to do in town. Was a perfect base for our mid-week trip",
      "We really enjoyed our weekend at Nicolas’s place.  Super cozy and had everything we needed for hosting a small family thanksgiving dinner.  Nicolas checked in to make sure everything was great for our stay.   <br/>Would definitely stay again!",
      "Such a beautiful character home in a wonderful neighbourhood. <br/>Loved our stay at Nicolas’ cozy and well appointed home, highly recommend and would absolutely love to stay here again. <br/>Communication was a breeze, walkable to all the best restaurants and a park right down the street. Thanks Nicolas!",
      "Nicolas was a fantastic host and always responsive when I had a question. The house was perfect for what I was looking for and I hope to stay again soon! Everything was clean and not cluttered. The kitchen was well equipped with everything I needed. Beds are extremely comfortable!!!",
      "Booking this place is one of our best things we did for our Banff trip. It is comfortable and quiet yet the location is very convenient for everything. There are so many great restaurants within walking distance. We went to Calgary downtown. We had a great family time together.",
      "Great place to stay in a nice area of Calgary. Very close to the river and St. Mary’s Cathedral. Be advised there are several risqué pictures throughout the house, so families should be wary. A bit strange and unnecessary, but otherwise everything was great.",
      "We loved our (second time) stay at this charming home - it’s thoughtfully decorated, has everything you could need and couldn’t be better located! We hope to be back again!",
      "This was a great place to stay for a weekend getaway. Great walking distance to a bunch of great restaurants, bars, groceries if needed. Great price and cleanliness of the house.",
      "Great house, close to downtown( 20min walk) we came for the stampede and that was the perfect location if you want to be close but not to close that you can enjoy some quiet time. A lot of restaurants around. Grocery and pharmacy less than 10min walk as well.  We had a good time.",
      "We had a great stay in Calgary at Nicolas’s place in the Mission area. The location was perfect, close to great restaurants and with easy access to all parts of the city. The space was beautifully decorated and thoughtfully stocked with everything we needed for a comfortable week-long stay. It truly felt like a home away from home. Nicolas provided clear, helpful instructions for check-in and using everything in the home, which made our stay seamless. Would definitely stay here again!",
      "Nicolas’s house was the perfect place for a ladies weekend. Beds were comfortable and linens were soft. Well stocked kitchen and great location. Short walk to pubs, restaurants and parks. Would stay again.",
      "Great location. Nicolas is very responsive. Beautifully styled with every creature comfort you’d require to be comfortable. Sauna and gym were a wonderful bonus addition. Would absolutely stay again!",
      "This place is LOVELY. So well taken care of and decorated. Overflowing with charm and character. We were very comfy during our stay!",
      "A very comfortable character home in a great neighborhood.  Close to many great restaurants.  Nicolas was friendly and easy to deal with.  Would definitely stay again.",
      "The location is great and plenty of space for myself and my girlfriend. The space is well decorated. We would happily rent this again if we come back to Calgary.",
      "Our group of 5 stayed here comfortably! The space is beautiful and in a great location. Large comfortable beds, and a couch big enough for us to all enjoy a movie in the living room. Lots of restaurants etc. in walking distance but the house itself is situated on a quiet street. Nicolas was helpful and responsive and I would recommend staying here.",
      "I had a fantastic stay at Nicholas’s place! The home was absolutely beautiful, thoughtfully decorated, and very comfortable. The location was perfect. Nicholas was an amazing host, super responsive and attentive, making sure everything was perfect throughout my stay. I would highly recommend his place to anyone looking for a great experience.",
      "We had a fantastic experience, staying at this house. The house is equipped with everything and more you could wish for.<br/>We all agreed, we loved the interior design and will boom to stay here again , should we visit Calgary in future.<br/>Nicolas is the perfect host. Responsive, helpful and friendly.<br/>The neighbourhood is perfect as restaurants are so close by, we could walk despite the really cold climate.<br/>Thank you Nicolas!",
      "This house is such a gem! Location wise, I don't know that you could do better. 17th Ave is just a couple of blocks away, the Saddledome is within walking distance as is the Core Shopping Centre and downtown Calgary. At the home you get to park in the driveway off the street. The house is spotlessly clean and filled with charm. We will absolutely stay with Nicolas again.",
      "The place is very well located. Parking available, fast wifi but the house is very old, has some humidity smell and has a hunted house vibe.",
      "Great place to stay in downtown Calgary. Within walking distance to most things and/or a very short Uber drive.  <br/>We are a family of 5 and stayed for two nights.  Fit our family just fine, but it is a smaller home so keep that in mind if you’re a family that likes lots of space.  <br/>Instructions were super clear and the place is very well styled and fully equipped with all the amenities you’d want.  <br/>The upper loft area is very cute, great for the kids.  <br/>There is no AC but there are plenty of oscillating fans and ceiling fans in the kitchen and master bedroom.  It wasn’t a big deal for us as the temps were fine, but the loft would get pretty hot I would imagine on a hot day.  Lots of windows up there though and Calgary tends to have pretty cool nights most of the time anyways.  <br/>Overall, great stay and I would highly recommend.",
      "Perfect location, clean, had everything we needed. Host took care of a lot of details. Would stay here again for sure!",
      "We had a relaxing weekend stay and enjoyed the well-stocked kitchen, comfy king beds, and roasty sauna as we prepared to run the Hypothermic Half Marathon on Sunday. Being able to pop over to Lindsey Park for a scenic walk or to a nearby cafe for pastries was delightful!"

Fit our family just fine, but it is a smaller home so keep that in mind if you’re a family that likes lots of space.  <br/>Instructions were super clear and the place is very well styled and fully equipped with all the amenities you’d want.  <br/>The upper loft area is very cute, great for the kids.  <br/>There is no AC but there are plenty of oscillating fans and ceiling fans in the kitchen and master bedroom.  It wasn’t a big deal for us as the temps were fine, but the loft would get pretty hot I would imagine on a hot day.  Lots of windows up there though and Calgary tends to have pretty cool nights most of the time anyways.  <br/>Overall, great stay and I would highly recommend.",
        "host_response": "Thank you so much for the thoughtful review and for being such great guests! We’re glad the location, clear instructions, style, and loft worked well for your family. Just a small note for future guests: the home does have air conditioning, in addition to the ceiling and oscillating fans. On hotter days, we recommend setting the A/C a bit earlier and using the fans to circulate cool air up to the loft. We’d love to host you again next time you’re in Calgary!"

      "Great place to stay and fit the 4 of us were very comfortably.  The views were amazing!  Great location, driving seemed to only take 15 minutes to get anywhere we went and the train was only a 5 minute walk away.  Chloe and Jason were super easy to get ahold of and also kept us very informed of anything we needed to know.",
      "View was great, couch was horrible, I would not consider that a bed in any sense of the word, the metal bars were easily felt even for a child size/weight.  If you are expecting to use that for a bed, reconsider.  The bunk beds and trundle bed were really good though and waking up to the views was enjoyable.",
      "place was great. mountain view and city view both. <br/>very clean when we got there and their welcome booklet was very useful indeed. <br/>not too demanding for a checkout/clean up procedure. <br/>loved the place. would like to use it next time we're in Calgary",
      "Hosts had excellent communication and responded promptly to any inquiries we had. The views and nearby entertainment were unbelievable in the best ways. I would 10/10 recommend there airbnb to anyone and would absolutely use it again myself.",
      "The place was great and we had a comfortable stay. Hosts were great and responsive to every question and concern I had and the instructions were very detailed when it came to check-in and check-out.",
      "The place is very nice, clean and very comfortable especially with the beautiful night view of downtown & and rest of Calgary from 24th floor, the family love it! Chloe & Jason are so wonderful with communication; they respond to messages quickly without delay and the check-in guide pdf is so unique and precise. The location was central for all of our activities at Calgary. I strongly recommend and will surely come back. Great accommodation for the family!",
      "We really appreciated our stay here — the location was perfect for us, right downtown with beautiful views of the city. Communication with our host was excellent; we always received quick and helpful answers to our questions, which made our stay smooth and easy.<br/>A couple of things to note: the dryer wasn’t working properly, so we had to air dry our clothes in the apartment. That said, the host was quick to let us know they would get it fixed for the next guests, which we appreciated. Also, while the space was generally comfortable, we’d rate the cleanliness around 3.5/5.<br/>Overall, we’re thankful for the experience and enjoyed our time here!",
      "lovely place with a very nice view in the heart of downtown . Also thanks for the crib and high chair, that was a big thing for us we didn't have room in our car to bring ours. Thank you Chloe and Jason for hosting us. I wish you all the best 🙏.",
      "The place was as we were expecting it to be.<br/>It was very easy to get in, extremely clean. We all loved the balcony, the views from there and the location of course.<br/>Having a parking spot at the building was such a great bonus to all amenities provided.",
      "Very nice clean place suitable for all types of different groups of people. The access to the pool and area is also very nice. Great location easy to get to many different activities",
      "An amazing location and view, our family of 5 was very comfortable. Thanks for a great stay!",
      "This bnb was exactly what my friends and I needed for a birthday night out on the town! The location was very convenient and close to many restaurants options. The view from the bnb was spectacular and the bnb itself was clean and homey. Chloe and Jason were very responsive and helpful. Would definitely stay here again!",
      "We survived our stay here but we’re definitely disappointed. This rental is NOT designed to hold 7 people at all! The pictures were deceiving and we felt like the apartment was wayyyy smaller than it seemed online. Even their couch is small and doesn’t even have a fold out bed - just an ottoman that pops up and we had to sleep two people on the tiny space. <br/>Check-in is less than ideal - car full of people has to wait on the streets or drive around while one person gets let in and has to go to high floor to retrieve key fob and then come down to find car to park on 5th floor underground parking. <br/>Plus, we were only left 4 towels for the 7 of us (owners did try to rectify this one thing for us), there’s only two chairs on patio with one cushion (picture shows a loveseat as well), the bedding for the trundle was not left for us so our son just had to use a random blanket, and the couch has no sheets for it, just a comforter for on top. <br/>One tiny bathroom to share was hard, too.",
      "I will never stay here again. I booked this property to celebrate my birthday, but instead spent the weekend struggling with allergies due to the place being dusty, unkempt, and overall unclean. Upon arrival, the floors were dirty, there was leftover laundry from previous guests, and hair was scattered on the floors. The towels were also stained, and the carpets were far from clean.<br/>The hosts did manage to have the place cleaned the next day, which did make a noticeable difference, but the dust and uncleanliness still lingered. I highly suggest a thorough cleaning of the vents and carpets. As a Superhost, I expect a higher level of cleanliness, but unfortunately, this was not the case. While the hosts made an effort to address the situation, I should never have arrived to an Airbnb that was still in poor condition after the previous guest.",
      "Got a wonderful stay ! <br/>The location was perfect bars, restaurants, store and shops, near the place<br/>The view was incredible ! <br/>Hosts were friendly and helpful. <br/>Thank you",
      "Great place, clean and came with complimentary bottles of water and microwave popcorn. Great views, very clean and comfortable stay. Perfect location for downtown outings.",
      "Great stay, the view is truly stunning! Hosts were very quick to answer any issues that came up and super quick to resolve them! Would definitely recommend to anyone looking to stay in Calgary for a good price. <br/>Only thing I’d mention is we would told early check-in was $40 but couldn’t be completed until day of, and day of was charged $50. <br/> Absolutely amazing hosts. We weren’t worried about the extra $10 but for someone who is just keep in mind of that and make sure that communication is there.",
      "Chloe and Jason were so responsive and delightful to deal with. The views from the bunk room were UNBEATABLE! Bunk room is good for kids. Master bedroom is comfortable for adults. Walk to the grocery store is easy and kitchen is well appointed.",
      "My family had an absolutely amazing stay. <br/>Chloe and Jason are super amazing hosts! <br/>Their check in & checkout manual in general was top notch. 😀 we will be staying again in the future.",
      "Extremely convenient location. Was easy to locate and get to the room. Nice to have a building with fast elevators and security that watches the entrance. No questions I’ll be rebooking again !",
      "The location was perfect, exactly as described and shown in the pictures. The space was just like in the photos—spacious, clean, and very comfortable. The host provided clear and detailed check-in and check-out instructions, making the process smooth and hassle-free. Additionally, the info sheet shared by the host was extremely helpful, covering everything I needed to know for a seamless stay. I highly recommend this place for anyone looking for a convenient and well-managed stay!",
      "Great location, and great views!  The belt line is a fun location in Calgary.  Chloe and Jason were quick to respond and had great instructions.  We will stay here again.",
      "I loved the view from this place it was incredible, only critiques are wifi is pretty much unusable, and the initial bit of getting checked in is tricky the touchpad is clearly broken, doorman helped though!",
      "Great place for a staycation. We were using this place for work from home. The WiFi could have been better, but we managed it by disconnecting phones and keeping only our office laptops connected to the WiFi. Nice views and lot of coffee shops and restaurants in walkable distance."

That said, the host was quick to let us know they would get it fixed for the next guests, which we appreciated. Also, while the space was generally comfortable, we’d rate the cleanliness around 3.5/5.<br/>Overall, we’re thankful for the experience and enjoyed our time here!",

The pictures were deceiving and we felt like the apartment was wayyyy smaller than it seemed online. Even their couch is small and doesn’t even have a fold out bed - just an ottoman that pops up and we had to sleep two people on the tiny space. <br/>Check-in is less than ideal - car full of people has to wait on the streets or drive around while one person gets let in and has to go to high floor to retrieve key fob and then come down to find car to park on 5th floor underground parking. <br/>Plus, we were only left 4 towels for the 7 of us (owners did try to rectify this one thing for us), there’s only two chairs on patio with one cushion (picture shows a loveseat as well), the bedding for the trundle was not left for us so our son just had to use a random blanket, and the couch has no sheets for it, just a comforter for on top. <br/>One tiny bathroom to share was hard, too.",

I booked this property to celebrate my birthday, but instead spent the weekend struggling with allergies due to the place being dusty, unkempt, and overall unclean. Upon arrival, the floors were dirty, there was leftover laundry from previous guests, and hair was scattered on the floors. The towels were also stained, and the carpets were far from clean.<br/>The hosts did manage to have the place cleaned the next day, which did make a noticeable difference, but the dust and uncleanliness still lingered. I highly suggest a thorough cleaning of the vents and carpets. As a Superhost, I expect a higher level of cleanliness, but unfortunately, this was not the case. While the hosts made an effort to address the situation, I should never have arrived to an Airbnb that was still in poor condition after the previous guest.",

Finding this apartment seemed perfect and the communication with all 3 contacts was prompt and informative.

      "It was about 15minutes away by walk to go to the main downtown so it was convenient  to access stores, restaurants. <br/>The area was peaceful and quiet so I liked it. <br/>Also I stayed here with my cats, there were most of amenities I needed so I didn't have to buy anything to stay at first except food.<br/>And she checked if I need any help or have any problem.",
      "Comfortable place to unwind or walkable to all the bars and restaurants.  Bed was nice and soft with black out curtains.",
      "With a great location, Naomi's put us where we wanted to be for our stay in Calgary. The apartment was clean except for a couple oversights from the cleaners but it didn't affect our stay. The welcome goodies were a nice touch and appreciated. The bathroom was clean although make sure you like a high pressure shower before you get in! Our only downsides to our stay was the second bedroom bed and the flooring in the main part of the house; which Naomi was happy to address both things when we spoke privately and they are aiming to fix these things for future guests. The bed in the second room was a very hard squeaky mattress and unfortunately that was the downside in our stay as my husband and I couldn't stay together on it. The floors need some repairs as some tiles were broken and loose, but Naomi let me know they are working on getting them fixed which can be appreciated. Naomi's response time was quick and professional. We will be back to stay in the future with the changes made.",
      "Would definitely stay here again on a return trip to Calgary. In great downtown area close to grocery stores, bakeries, restaurants and shopping.",
      "Naomi was very friendly, and made sure we had everything we needed. She even left us with some goodies.",
      "Stayed for two nights, mixed experience. Nice aesthetics but lacks some basic needs. Hosts are friendly and helpful. They were communicative and also arranged a fan upon request, though we had to sleep in about 25-30 degrees on the first night.<br/>Parking instructions are quite confusing, we kept second doubting until the host confirmed (this could be easily resolved with attaching a picture and annotating it). <br/>Internet pretty slow for WFH.<br/>No kitchen paper towels provided. <br/>Most pots and pans don’t have lids. <br/>Only 2-3 dishwasher pods were given and kept in the open near the sink, they all got moist and stuck together. <br/>Black and dark blue towels are provided, which is inappropriate, you can’t tell if it’s clean, white is a standard for a reason. <br/>Bathtub has dark shower curtains and there’s no light in the shower area.<br/>Toiletries (shampoo and all) are poured into glass bottles, you don’t know what you are using on your body.<br/>Hope this helps the host and guests:)",
      "The flat is really nice and quite big, within walking distance from the city centre and various food options.",
      "Naomi's place is so cozy!! You can't get any better for location, anything you could possibly need is only a few blocks away. Great host! I will be definitely booking a return stay next time I'm in town.",
      "Easy and convenient. Clean and lovely!",
      "great place and location and great hoste",
      "It's a great place to enjoy Stempid.<br/>It was a lodging. Not only that, but the downtown was also within walking distance, so it was comfortable and nice. The kitchen and bathroom were clean and the interior was well done. The bed was comfortable, so I was able to sleep well. If I come back to Calgary, I think I'll definitely come back to this place.",
      "Great location, nice large space, very clean. Would definitely stay here again!",
      "Excellent accommodation to end our stay! Super cozy comfortable beds, super sofa for a relaxing evening, very quiet outside with beautiful views of the city, not far from the city center and the 17th, nice street for bars and restaurants hehe <br/>We are delighted with our last days in Calgary!",
      "Everything worked out well and I felt very comfortable right away. The apartment is very cozy, the area is very quiet and there are great restaurants nearby! By bus and also on foot, I could reach everything quickly. I had a good time and would come back!",
      "We enjoyed our stay!",
      "Great location, central yet quiet, nice apartment for our family with 2 children",
      "Quiet area close to center The apartment is suitable for groups of friends or family."

The apartment was clean except for a couple oversights from the cleaners but it didn't affect our stay. The welcome goodies were a nice touch and appreciated. The bathroom was clean although make sure you like a high pressure shower before you get in! Our only downsides to our stay was the second bedroom bed and the flooring in the main part of the house; which Naomi was happy to address both things when we spoke privately and they are aiming to fix these things for future guests. The bed in the second room was a very hard squeaky mattress and unfortunately that was the downside in our stay as my husband and I couldn't stay together on it. The floors need some repairs as some tiles were broken and loose, but Naomi let me know they are working on getting them fixed which can be appreciated. Naomi's response time was quick and professional. We will be back to stay in the future with the changes made.",

        "review": "Stayed for two nights, mixed experience. Nice aesthetics but lacks some basic needs. Hosts are friendly and helpful. They were communicative and also arranged a fan upon request, though we had to sleep in about 25-30 degrees on the first night.<br/>Parking instructions are quite confusing, we kept second doubting until the host confirmed (this could be easily resolved with attaching a picture and annotating it). <br/>Internet pretty slow for WFH.<br/>No kitchen paper towels provided. <br/>Most pots and pans don’t have lids. <br/>Only 2-3 dishwasher pods were given and kept in the open near the sink, they all got moist and stuck together. <br/>Black and dark blue towels are provided, which is inappropriate, you can’t tell if it’s clean, white is a standard for a reason. <br/>Bathtub has dark shower curtains and there’s no light in the shower area.<br/>Toiletries (shampoo and all) are poured into glass bottles, you don’t know what you are using on your body.<br/>Hope this helps the host and guests:)",
        "host_response": "Thank you for your feedback Anikesh. <br/>the condo is in a concrete building that stays naturally cool and cools quickly with fans. As stated in the listing, there is no AC, which is common in Calgary. <br/>We use black and navy towels for their quality and durability, and all linens are professionally laundered. Soaps and shampoos are provided in clearly labeled glass bottles as part of our eco-conscious approach. We only provide quality products.<br/>Our cleaning care team follows the highest standards, and we pride ourselves on offering a spotless, well-equipped space. <br/>Unfortunately, this guest left the unit dirty, left balcony doors open, and did not follow checkout instructions, creating safety and cleanliness concerns.<br/>We remain committed to delivering a high-quality experience for respectful guests."

      "The location cannot be beat.  you're surrounded by so many good restaurants that is within walking distance.<br/>The apartment was super clean and we appreciated it.  We were grateful that there was also a washer and dryer in the unit which helps immensely especially when you have little ones.  <br/>we'd definitely stay again should we ever visit Calgary a second time.",
      "Terrible host: I texted already about the time I will reach (11 pm), and when I reached I called for access and their was no response  😑.  In midnight I was left stranded with my baby and family and lot of stress. I have to go to hotel and due this all this hasel my next went bad due to lack of sleep. Airbnb staff helped me on call to tackle as best as possible.",
      "Fantastic location…walkable to concert at the Saddledome, lots of great restaurants and amenities just steps away and easily walkable to shopping downtown or on 17 Avenue. Loved our time here!",
      "Amanda’s condo is in our favourite Beltline building but this was our first time staying in her unit, it will be our future go to! Her place is so clean, beautiful view and she is so friendly! My daughter forgot her computer and she messaged us right away and helped us make arrangements to get it returned to us. We were there for three nights and never used our car, everything is so close. Great big bathrooms with lots of counter space, comfy beds & couch, free Netflix. The units in this building are practically soundproof too which is lovely.",
      "City Centre Suite is right on the beltline a short walk from BMO and the Stampede grounds. Everything was well thought out and the Nespresso coffee was awesome. The view at night of the city is beautiful and the place is just like the photos. Highly recommend!",
      "We had a stress free incredible stay. So many options for food and entertainment right outside the door. Very clean and had everthing we required. The host was attentive to any messages and easy to deal with. Highly reccomend you stay here!!",
      "This apartment is pristine - immaculate design, open plan, beautiful balcony. Plenty of space & privacy. The building is secure & easy to find/access. Plenty of food in the area and easy access to public transport. Kids playground across the street with plenty of squirrels & a resident large rabbit. The apartment was a great base to explore the city & a nice place to rest after a long day. Quality coffee machine and washer/dryer facilities were a great addition",
      "Great location in the city! Close by lots of things to do, plenty of restaurants and coffee shops. Even though we had our car, we walked most of the time. Spacious apartment with a good view outside.",
      "Amanda’s condo was great! It was clean, free of clutter, perfect location and most importantly for us it was kid friendly. Made travelling with our son significantly easier. I lf we ever find ourselves in Calgary again, I would 100% stay here again.",
      "The apartment was great, centrally located. We were two different parties in the apartment so we appreciated having two bathrooms. Definitely a perk of the place, along with the great view. The building wad quiet as well. <br/>Amanda was very responsive and all questions were answered in a timely manner.",
      "Calgary Stampede Stay<br/>We stayed at Amanda’s apartment as two couples before we set off on a road trip and found the location great. It was very handy for the stampede but also for some great bars and restaurants. We did a street art and beer tour and despite it raining the entire time we had a great time. The directions to access the apartment were spot on and communication was first rate. We would definitely recommend staying here.",
      "We loved Amanda’s BnB. Great location! So many neat little shops nearby - bakery, coffee, markets, etc. as well as quick access to 8th avenue pedestrian street. <br/>Enjoyed the bright and airy open concept living room/kitchen. The patio was an added bonus! <br/>Beds were comfortable, space was very quiet, and having 2 bathrooms were a bonus. <br/>Highly recommend, and we will look it up again if we’re visiting Calgary.",
      "Good location for what our needs were. Area is a bit “sketchy “ depending on where you walked. Bed linens were adequate with terrible pillows. Bedroom with ensuite has no windows so felt like you were in a dungeon with 4 of us staying in the unit. No paper towels/napkins, no Kleenex, any extras were non existent. Washcloths had long black hair left in them from previous patrons.",
      "Amanda’s place was perfect for our stay in Calgary for a wedding. Her place was spacious, clean, and the kitchen had everything we needed! The robes and slippers were also a nice added touch!",
      "We had a great time in Calgary! The location is awesome and near to lots of nice bars/restaurants and in a very walkable neighborhood. The instructions for check-in were super clear and the apt is spacious",
      "I stayed here with a friend for three nights for a conference. Place is beautiful and well appointed. The bedrooms are big for a condo and there’s two full bathrooms, which was nice. The only criticism I have is the building itself. There’s not a lot of soundproofing between units, so we could hear everything that was going on upstairs. People were having loud parties until 3 AM and we could hear if they dropped something on the floor. It was quite loud With almost no soundproofing and kept us up at night. Other than that, great place to stay.",
      "Great place to stay, reasonable and good location. Would highly recommend this place to someone else",
      "Very comfortable, beautiful unit. Area was a little sketchy to walk around at night but during the day is lively with many great restaurants and very walkable.",
      "Loved the location.  Perfect for everything we planned to do over the weekend and we were able to walk.",
      "beautiful stay, her recommendations for places and food in a book provided we’re all great. Definitely recommend Native Tongue & Beltliner for anyone looking to stay in the future. Balcony had amazing views favourite morning sunrise spot during stay. So close to lots to do downtown. A great stay 10/10",
      "Great stay — simple check-in, very clean, and perfect location.",
      "The place is great, super comfortable, clean, and centrally located. Amanda was very friendly. I would definitely stay here again and recommend it 100%.",
      "Amanda’s Airbnb is lovely, clean, cosy, in a great location and lets in so much natural light. Would recommend and would happily stay here again. Thank you!",
      "The extra details were great. Robe, slippers and a blanket for couch sitting. Great location! <br/>would stay there again"

Her place is so clean, beautiful view and she is so friendly! My daughter forgot her computer and she messaged us right away and helped us make arrangements to get it returned to us. We were there for three nights and never used our car, everything is so close. Great big bathrooms with lots of counter space, comfy beds & couch, free Netflix. The units in this building are practically soundproof too which is lovely.",

The bedrooms are big for a condo and there’s two full bathrooms, which was nice. The only criticism I have is the building itself. There’s not a lot of soundproofing between units, so we could hear everything that was going on upstairs. People were having loud parties until 3 AM and we could hear if they dropped something on the floor. It was quite loud With almost no soundproofing and kept us up at night. Other than that, great place to stay.",
        "host_response": "Glad to hear most of your stay was wonderful. Our building has just enforced the use of noise meters, so those are currently being installed in hopes we can limit this type of disruption. I hope you will consider us for your next visit to Calgary and we can provide a peaceful night sleep for you."

It comfortably accommodates  two guests but we can host up to three guests thanks to a pull-out couch. It boasts a prime location just off the vibrant 17th avenue, steps away from shopping, entertainment, nightlife, parks, transit, sports venues, and urgent care. **NOTE: The condo has recently had a fresh coat of paint and the art’s come down, but it still wraps you up in cozy vibes like a favorite sweater <3The spaceWhile small, the suite has a dedicated bedroom with a queen bed, and a pullout  couch in the living room. The entire unit would be yours for your stay, you do not share with other guests.Guest accessKeys and Access fob will be given upon check-inOther things to notePlenty of free street parking nearby. The Sheldon Chumir Urgent Care Centre is just a 5-minute walk away, as is Safeway for your grocery needs. You’ll also find a pharmacy and liquor store right across the street, along with a great selection of cafes and restaurants just around the corner. Overall, it’s a fantastic location for an inner city Calgary experience. If you’re visiting during Stampede, you can’t beat the location; walking distance to the grounds!Registration DetailsBL260632",

      "Great location, great space. the furniture could use some updating but minor in the grand scheme of things. everything is very walkable, parking isn't too difficult to manage. I would absolutely stay here again. All the best!",
      "Overall great experience! The condo was clean and homey. Very convenient location with lots of restaurants and bars around. A grocery store being walkable distance is also a huge plus. Had to park my car on the street but finding a spot wasn't too bad.",
      "Torie and Tyler were super flexible with our plans. They responded quite quickly to any questions we had. Their place is walkable to a lot of amenities and funky restaurants. Street was quiet. Would definitely stay here again!",
      "We had a great stay! The place was clean, comfortable, and exactly as described. The host was responsive, which made everything smooth. Perfect for a short trip. Would definitely book again!",
      "Great place 👌🏾 Torie and Tyler  communicated well. Despite not being able to enjoy the area its in an excellent area for dining, walking and enjoying the 17 Ave vibe! Thank you 😊",
      "Super convenient location and the condo was the perfect meet between everything you could have needed and the perfect amount of space!! Torie and Tyler were ever so accommodating. I really enjoyed my stay, thank you",
      "Tone of voice host used was not professional. Location is good. Parking is fine but has handicap sign. Wasn’t sure if it was correct to park there. Nails popping out on table. No A/C.",
      "Great location and perfect size. I’ll be staying there again whenever I’m back in the area. Very happy with everything.",
      "Great place! Very clean, close to a lot of activities and restaurants but still in a quiet street.",
      "Extremely clean and great view from the balcony! <br/>I’ll definitely book again the location was amazing and the apartment has everything I’ll ever need",
      "Great price for location. Check-in time of 5pm was a little abnormal but we made it work. Clean space and great balcony view.",
      "easy check in instructions and very responsive! the apartment has a great view! plus the parking lot makes everything easier!<br/>totally recommend!",
      "Okay location- somewhat convenient. Apartment walls and doors were dirty, sofa bed was broken and uncomfortable. Parking was a nightmare, check-in and out was complicated. Host had their notifications silenced so we had to wait a bit for getting checked in, and they weren’t great with their response times. I don’t think I’d stay here again.",
      "Great Apt close to 17th Ave and very walkable. Bed was comfortable and the place was spotless clean",
      "Beautiful place, lovely interior. Torie and Tyler were amazing hosts and so responsive and flexible! recommend this place to everyone!",
      "In the heart of the city.<br/>Highly recommended!!<br/>Comfortable and very clean place.<br/>Beautiful views from the balcony.<br/>Very nice location.",
      "A wonderful spot to stay if you want to feel connected to the big Calgary city life. Comfy bed, warm shower and amazing restaurants nearby.",

      "Our stay at Torie and Tyler’s place was fantastic! The space was clean, cozy, and exactly as described. The hosts were super responsive, went out of their way to accommodate our schedule, and made check-in a breeze. The location was perfect for exploring Calgary. I’d definitely book again!",
      "Clean, affordable, and very easy check in, not to mention it being smack dab in a beautiful location. Absolutely loved the cute cozy interior even though i wasnt there for very long, the place had everything youd need and it comes with a great view. Holing to visit again if im in calgary.",
      "Beautiful high-end kitchen with all the amenities. Super clean. Stayed here one night with my son, and the neighborhood was filled with great restaurants and walkable. The hosts were really helpful with recommendations and considerations, and very friendly and responsive. <br/>Only thing I would say is that I would recommend leaving any large suitcases in the car as there is not much space to move around inside the unit with all the decorations. not much space to move around in the kitchen once the chairs are placed around the table. No noise at all and a phenomenal view.",
      "Great place, excellent location. Only stayed 1 night but came away very relaxed. Had a nice bath in their soaker tub, and enjoyed the beautiful view of the city lights. Thanks again!",
      "Nice place, fantastic location with lots of nice bars and cafes nearby. Only thing was there are no blinds over the balcony door, so you will get a ton of sunshine in the morning, which could be an issue if you're a light sleeper.",
      "We had such a wonderful time at your Airbnb! It was cute, comfortable, had everything we needed, and was in a great location.  Thank you SO much!<br/>The reviews about the place being small are a bit overblown. It’s a studio apartment and has everything you’d need. It’s far better than a hotel.<br/>The other reviews about the check-in time seem strange. We found the host accommodating and friendly. They were clear about their check-in and check-out times. As a night owl it was perfect to have such a late check-out time."

      "The host was responsive and easy to communicate with. <br/>The space some major repairs, floor boards were missing, Cabinets are peeling, holes in walls the tub would not drain, Bedroom door was broken. To list a few things. <br/>I personally would not stay here again. Due to the amount of issues with the unit.",
      "Luxury at its best!<br/>Do not get in this home if you are only staying for one night in Calgary. This home is insanely nice, as seen from the photos. <br/>It is luxury at its best in the heart of Calgary. It is close to some of the nicest restaurants, kids play areas and awesome evening and night life for you and my partner. <br/>We loved it and promise to come but for at least a week of staying in this luxurious apartment. <br/>This is five stars all the way baby!",
      "Well worth the stay. Large apartment, two comfortable bedrooms, large living room and great large outdoor patio. Well worth it.",
      "I would not recommend staying here. The photos are outdated and don’t reflect the current condition—floorboards are lifted and taped, surfaces grimy, floors sticky, and bedding smelled unwashed. Dishes and cutlery were greasy. The place felt very unclean. At check-in, the keys weren’t where instructed, and although parking was advertised, no key fob was provided, forcing us to pay for street parking. The worst issue was a power outage. No one came to resolve it, leaving the unit unstayable. We had to leave early and find another place. Nomadics Vacation Rentals offered no real help, repeatedly deflecting refund requests, never sending someone to fix it and even accused us of never checking out. Communication was frustrating. While the location is walkable and the pool is nice, it’s far from the “luxury” advertised and not worth the price. Based on my experience and recent reviews, they no longer care for this property—book elsewhere to avoid disappointment.",
      "Very great place it was amazing thank you for being such a wonderful host",
      "I rarely leave negative reviews, but this stay was disappointing. The listing photos are extremely misleading.. what we walked into was a completely different reality.<br/>The unit was dirty: used mugs and cutlery in the sink, dried snot on the bathroom wall, baseboards caked with dust and grime, floor is lifting in the kitchen badly and pretty much every wall is covered in scuffs, dings, and visible damage. Cleanliness and upkeep were clearly not a priority here. There are no shades in one of the bedrooms. Reviews from months ago flagged this same issue, and it still hasn't been addressed, even with temporary curtains.. at least! <br/>On top of that, there was a surprise request for an additional damage deposit fee before check in instructions would be provided. <br/>Bottom line: luxury it is not. This place needs a deep clean, proper maintenance, and a host who’s willing to put some effort into the experience. I would not stay here again or recommend it to anyone.",
      "We (4 colleagues on a work trip) enjoyed our stay at this airbnb & would recommend it. The airbnb had a pullout couch (fits 2 people tightly), a rollaway cot (fits 1 person), 1 king bed in 1 room, & another king bed in another room. The bedrooms are quite small - just a bed & some space to walk around it/put your stuff. There are 2 full bathroom, one attached to one bedroom & another attached to the living room. The bathrooms were functional & clean as was the kitchen (we struggled & failed to get the dishwasher to work, but that could have been user error?) & the washer/dryer. The view from the balcony is stunning - we spent a lot of time there. While the airbnb company sent instructions on how to get in, we did struggle entering the complex. There is also only one key fob which we had to juggle/share amongst 4 independent adults which was a bit difficult and cumbersome. The area was alright - walkable, close to downtown but there were a fair number of unhoused folks nearby.",
      "Condo was nice but no shades in one of the rooms, Location was loud, and no sheets for pull out.",
      "The place was great! Perfect location. Eddie was great with great communication!<br/>Would definitely return",
      "Nomadics Vacation rentals sent extremely detailed check in and check out instructions and the apartment matched the pictures shown in the listing. The apartment was extremely clean and clutter free. The amenities at this location looked nice although we did not have time to use any of them. We were unfortunately moved to this apartment after the initial apartment had an extremely last minute plumbing issue. The last minute nature of this issue and the communication regarding the change was rather frustrating. In addition, this new apartment had 1 less bedroom than my original booking. Forcing us to utilize the pull out bed, which would have been no big deal if sheets for this bed had been provided or available. In addition, all the extra pillows were provided with no pillow cases. we pulled pillows off the real beds for the couch to use. Location was easily walkable to the other downtown areas.",
      "stains on the bath towel and sofa cushion, no curtain or blinds in one room which is extremely inconvenient and no privacy, should not happen with appartement like this",
      "Unfortunately, our experience was quite disappointing. We arrived at the apartment on February 6th at 10:46 pm and immediately had trouble getting into the building. The doorman was unfriendly and unwilling to help, and the building control panel was very confusing, the buttons didn't work properly and there were no clear instructions. Inside the apartment, the curtain in the suite was damaged, which compromised our privacy, as we had to sleep completely exposed to the outside light. The next day, we asked for some flexibility with the check-out time, but the host was completely inflexible and wanted to charge an additional $125 just to stay until 2:30 pm. Another point worth mentioning: in addition to the normal Airbnb booking fee, there was an extra charge of $27.30 for a so-called \"non-refundable damage waiver\", without explaining what happened. This fee is charged regardless of whether or not damages were caused. I recommend that future guests read all the details.",
      "Overall the space was perfect for what we needed over the weekend.  A few things need some minor repairs in the unit, but nothing major.  We didn't have enough towels for all staying in the room, but that was quickly alleviated by the team, which was nice.  Only one of the two elevators works in the building so if you need to use it and don't want to be waiting in line, I strongly auggest utilizing it in the early morning or late night hours.  The space was perfectly located for our needs on the trip.",
      "The area was perfection as well as the cleanliness of the suite. Our host was very quick to respond to any questions we had and it was an overall lovely stay. Can’t wait to go back :)",
      "Spent 3 days here with my friends for my birthday weekend! We had an absolute blast. The apartment is GORGEOUS from interior decorations to the stunning views through the floor to ceiling windows. Everyone slept super comfortably we spent so much time in the room because we were so obsessed hahaha ! It’s a great location in downtown with plenty of options for food, shopping, and exploring the beautiful city. Nomadic’s communicated great and made everything super easy with the self check in. Can’t wait to go back for another stay, definitely planning a longer trip just for this place 😍😍",

      "I had an absolutely fantastic experience at this Airbnb! The property was exactly as described—clean, comfortable, and equipped with everything I needed for a relaxing stay. The location was perfect, close to all the key attractions, yet quiet enough to unwind after a long day.<br/>What really stood out, however, was the host’s hospitality. They were incredibly responsive, thoughtful, and went above and beyond to make my stay special. From providing local recommendations to ensuring I had all the essentials, their attention to detail made me feel right at home.<br/>I would highly recommend this Airbnb to anyone looking for a seamless, cozy, and welcoming place to stay.

The photos are outdated and don’t reflect the current condition—floorboards are lifted and taped, surfaces grimy, floors sticky, and bedding smelled unwashed. Dishes and cutlery were greasy. The place felt very unclean. At check-in, the keys weren’t where instructed, and although parking was advertised, no key fob was provided, forcing us to pay for street parking. The worst issue was a power outage. No one came to resolve it, leaving the unit unstayable. We had to leave early and find another place. Nomadics Vacation Rentals offered no real help, repeatedly deflecting refund requests, never sending someone to fix it and even accused us of never checking out. Communication was frustrating. While the location is walkable and the pool is nice, it’s far from the “luxury” advertised and not worth the price. Based on my experience and recent reviews, they no longer care for this property—book elsewhere to avoid disappointment.",
        "host_response": "We’re sorry to hear that your experience did not meet expectations. The photos and details of the property are current on our listing, and a parking fob was provided during your stay to ensure convenient access.<br/>Regarding the power outage, this was caused by an external utility issue beyond our control. Our team stayed in communication and did our best to provide support during this time. We also note that checkout was extended without authorization, which affected our ability to prepare the property for incoming guests.<br/>We truly value guest feedback, as it helps us continue improving!"

        "review": "I rarely leave negative reviews, but this stay was disappointing. The listing photos are extremely misleading.. what we walked into was a completely different reality.<br/>The unit was dirty: used mugs and cutlery in the sink, dried snot on the bathroom wall, baseboards caked with dust and grime, floor is lifting in the kitchen badly and pretty much every wall is covered in scuffs, dings, and visible damage. Cleanliness and upkeep were clearly not a priority here. There are no shades in one of the bedrooms. Reviews from months ago flagged this same issue, and it still hasn't been addressed, even with temporary curtains.. at least! <br/>On top of that, there was a surprise request for an additional damage deposit fee before check in instructions would be provided. <br/>Bottom line: luxury it is not. This place needs a deep clean, proper maintenance, and a host who’s willing to put some effort into the experience. I would not stay here again or recommend it to anyone.",

The airbnb had a pullout couch (fits 2 people tightly), a rollaway cot (fits 1 person), 1 king bed in 1 room, & another king bed in another room. The bedrooms are quite small - just a bed & some space to walk around it/put your stuff. There are 2 full bathroom, one attached to one bedroom & another attached to the living room. The bathrooms were functional & clean as was the kitchen (we struggled & failed to get the dishwasher to work, but that could have been user error?) & the washer/dryer. The view from the balcony is stunning - we spent a lot of time there. While the airbnb company sent instructions on how to get in, we did struggle entering the complex. There is also only one key fob which we had to juggle/share amongst 4 independent adults which was a bit difficult and cumbersome. The area was alright - walkable, close to downtown but there were a fair number of unhoused folks nearby.",

We were unfortunately moved to this apartment after the initial apartment had an extremely last minute plumbing issue. The last minute nature of this issue and the communication regarding the change was rather frustrating. In addition, this new apartment had 1 less bedroom than my original booking. Forcing us to utilize the pull out bed, which would have been no big deal if sheets for this bed had been provided or available. In addition, all the extra pillows were provided with no pillow cases. we pulled pillows off the real beds for the couch to use. Location was easily walkable to the other downtown areas.",

The doorman was unfriendly and unwilling to help, and the building control panel was very confusing, the buttons didn't work properly and there were no clear instructions. Inside the apartment, the curtain in the suite was damaged, which compromised our privacy, as we had to sleep completely exposed to the outside light. The next day, we asked for some flexibility with the check-out time, but the host was completely inflexible and wanted to charge an additional $125 just to stay until 2:30 pm. Another point worth mentioning: in addition to the normal Airbnb booking fee, there was an extra charge of $27.30 for a so-called \"non-refundable damage waiver\", without explaining what happened. This fee is charged regardless of whether or not damages were caused. I recommend that future guests read all the details.",
